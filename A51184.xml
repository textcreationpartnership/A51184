            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <p>From the Emperors Palace he made means to ſend a Letter to the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> in which he inform'd him at large both of the <hi>Aſiatick</hi> and <hi>African</hi> Countreys; and amongſt the reſt, deſcribed the City of <hi>Calicut,</hi> and gave a Character of the Inhabitants, who, he ſaid, were of a ſwarthy, and of an Ole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſter Complexion, ſcarce knowing ought of humanity or civil addreſs, unaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fable, irreligious, and ignorant of all Moral Vertue: they are proud of going naked from the Middle upwards, onely above their Elbows they wear Arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets of Pearl, and a Simiter in a Belt hangs thwart their Shoulders; and about their Middle they wear Skirts, or long Baſes of Purple-Silk, richly embroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd with Gold.</p>

The publick-ſpirited Party, which were, and are commonly the feweſt in all great Conſultations, convinced them in all their Arguments, ſaying, That they had no cauſe to complain of the Honor and Profit which the Nation had already gotten in their firſt Diſcoveries, but that it ſhould rather encourage them to proceed.

               <p>Thus having receiv'd his Inſtruction and Commiſſion, he departed with his Fleet out of the Haven of <hi>Lisbon,</hi> and Steer'd the ſame Courſe to <hi>St. James</hi> Iſland, as <hi>Gama</hi> had done before.

               <p>Notwithſtanding all theſe Rubs and Diſcouragements, his being ſtill more and more out of Purſe, and all his Endeavors turning to no account, but only feeding as it were vain Hopes; yet not one jot diſcountenanc'd, he went on ſtrenuouſly, and ſet out the year following a ſecond time <hi>Vaſques de Gama,</hi> with ten Ships, conceiving by his well-experienc'd Conduct, he might be more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate, and might at laſt ſet a better face upon the whole Affair; yet he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd with little better Succeſs than the former had done: But howſoever, the King went on, and would not be daunted, ſetting forth <hi>Vincent So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derio,</hi> next <hi>Stephano Gama,</hi> then <hi>Alphonſo</hi> and <hi>Franciſco Albuquerque,</hi> and after <hi>Gundiſſalo Coelio,</hi> with ſeveral Fleets; all which return'd but ſmall Audits, in lieu of his vaſt Expences.</p>
               <p>But at laſt, conſidering the whole weight of this high Concern lay only upon his Shoulders, and ſome few of the Nobility; his Merchants and Private Traders, and the whole Body of the People, not at all concern'd: Neither ſeeming willing, then, or at any time, to be ingag'd, either in their Purſe, or otherwiſe; he bethought himſelf (obſerving the Nation to be naturally Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious, and much inclin'd to hearken to Prophecies, and ſuch Follies of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Future Events) of a way, a ſubtile Artifice, to catch the whole People, or at leaſt the Richer ſort, with a new Device, or Royal Trepan, which was thus effected.</p>

Soon the fame of this was ſpread through all Parts thereabouts, which came at laſt with great wonder to the Kings Ear; but he ſhew'd himſelf more amaz'd and ſtrangelier concern'd than the Relater; and very earneſt ſuddenly to ſee and know what they might ſignifie, ſtraight commanded the Marbles to be brought to Court.

On the Weſt-ſide of the Chappel is good Anchorage, but they muſt lie near the Shore to keep them from Driving; for from betwixt the declivings of that Rocky Coaſt, the Wind comes often down with great violence, and ſudden guſts.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The Air.</note>The Air of this Iſland is very temperate and wholſom, inſomuch that the Sick which are brought out of the Ships on Shore there, ſoon recover their health. The Valleys are not more than moderately hot, the Mountains tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perately cold, being continually fann'd with cooling Breezes, and the Air is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frigerated
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:34669:22"/>frigerated with five or ſix Showres in a day, the Sun ſhining as oft betwixt; and though the Soil be naturally dry and barren, yet it is repleniſh'd with many Springs of ſweet and wholſom Water, eſpecially the <hi>Church Valley,</hi> through which, deſcending from the High-lands, glide ſeveral pleaſant Streams down to the Sea, for the great accommodation of thoſe that Anchor there, and put in forfreſh, Water; yet beſides this, they have two other, from whence they ſupply their wants.</p>
               <p>This Iſle, deſtitute of Inhabitants, may aſcribe its plenty of wild Gattel to a <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Merchant, who in the Year 1512 coming to Anchor here, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the pleaſant Situation, and the ſolitarineſs thereof, which then agreed well with his diſpoſition, being ſomething inclin'd to Melancholly, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been formerly much croſs'd in his Fortunes, wearied with buſineſs, and the cunning practiſes of thoſe he dealt withall, ſettled himſelf in this ſolitary Place, putting aſhore thoſe Sheep, Swine, and Poultrey he had aboard, which increaſed in a ſhort time to a Miracle, inſomuch that they ſuppli'd whomſoever touch'd there, with plenty of freſh Proviſion, and eſpecially after King <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Portugal</hi> iſſued out ſtrict Commands, prohibiting all his Subjects from ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling there.</p>
               <p>This Soil, though naturally (as we ſaid before) very dry and thirſty, is much fertiliz'd, being moiſtned by many Springs and ſhowry Weather, ſo that it bears variety of Fruits, eſpecially Peaſe and Beans, of which great ſtore are found growing every where, which when ripe, falling, ſowe themſelves, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſuch plenty.</p>
               <p>Here are alſo whole Groves of Orange, Lemon, Pomegranate, and Fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trees, which are always loaden with ripe, green Fruits, and Bloſſoms; and great Shades of Ebony and Roſe-trees: the Wood is not eaſie to be wrought, becauſe of its knottineſs. The Valleys are like Kitchin-Gardens, full of Parſly-Beds, Porcelin, Sorrel, and ſeveral other Herbs good for the Pot, and alſo for many Diſtempers, eſpecially the Griping of the Guts, a Diſeaſe very incident to ſuch as frequent theſe Parts.</p>
               <p>The Woods and Hills abound with all manner of Beaſts, as Goats, Deer, ſome as big as Stags, and alſo wild Swine of ſeveral colours, but very difficult to be taken. When the Portuguese firſt diſcover'd this Countrey, they found not any kind of Beaſt or Fruit-bearing Trees, all which they tranſported, Stocking and Planting of them there, which ſince have ſo ſpread themſelves, that both the Hills and Dales are ſatiated with them, without any art of Husbandry.</p>
               <p>Here are alſo Partridges, Pigeons, Peacocks, and Pheaſants, which cannot be taken either by Snares or Nets, but onely by Shooting. No Beaſts or Birds of Prey, Serpents, Toads, or Frogs, have here their receptacle; but ugly Spiders and Flies, ſome green like Graſhoppers.</p>
               <p>The Cliffs on the South-ſide of this Iſland entertain thouſands of gray and black Sea-Pies, or Mews; alſo ſpeckled and white Fowls, ſome with long, and ſome with ſhort Necks, which lay their Eggs (being of a good reliſh) in the Rocks. Theſe kind of Fowls the <hi>Netherlanders</hi> 1608 in a Voyage to the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> call'd them by <hi>Irony,</hi> Mad-Pies, being ſo tame and gentle, that they took them with their Hands, or knockt them down with their Sticks.</p>
               <p>Here the Sea-water which beats againſt the Rocks, remaining in a frothy foam upon them, whitened with the Sun, becomes pure Salt, and Salt-Petre.</p>

               <p>In the South-eaſt part of this Iſland is a Mountain, whoſe Earth being of a brightiſh brown, Dyes a good Red; and alſo one in the Eaſt, which yields a pure mixt colour, being brown above, and white below.</p>
               <p>The Sea near this Iſland abounds in Fiſh, but muſt be taken with Hooks, and not with Lines or Nets, becauſe of the foulneſs of the Ground; Carps, but of another colour than thoſe of <hi>Europe;</hi> Eels, about the thickneſs of a Mans Arm, and of a good taſte; Crabs, Lobſters, of better r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The next Article of their Faith is, that there are ſeveral Puniſhments after this life, according to the equality of their Crimes, and Rewards of eternal happineſs for thoſe that have, when living, merited by doing well: therefore they dig broad and deep Trenches, filling them with Mud and Slime; over, which they make a floating Bridge of bundled up Ruſhes, which leads to the moſt delightfulleſt and luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Vales in the Countrey: over theſe, as they affirm, the Souls of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed muſt paſs, which the Wicked endeavoring to croſs, the unſtable Truſs, or rowling Bridge, tumbles them over into their Stygian Lake: but the Juſt and Godly walking in ſafety over, enjoy there all pleaſure in an everlaſting Elyſium.</p>

Thus fleſh'd and encourag'd, deſerting the Hills, and their former Aboads, they pitch their Camps in open Plains,

                  <hi>The</hi> Japanners (ſaith he) <hi>are ſo capaciouſly apprehenſive, and ſo tractable, not onely eaſily yielding to Reaſon, but Matters of Faith, that when they come to us, are very inquiſitive and earneſt to be reſolv'd in ſome hard Queſtions of Religion, when we had firſt preſented them the original and immortality of the Soul, they were ſoon brought to an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and belief thereof: And when we ſet forth to them, That none could be ſav'd, nor Salvation granted by any, but the Father of all things, and Omnipotent Maker of Heaven and Earth; by which Arguments they were ſo ſuddenly convinced, and their former Reaſons, which led them on in their blind Superſtition, ſo totally routed, that without any farther ſcruple, or asking time to conſider, they abominated their old Idolatry, and were converted to good Chriſtians; which after receiv'd, they never waver'd not ſtagger'd from, moſt of them ſo reſolv'd, that they become Champions for</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>and were ready to lay down their Lives in maintaining the Truth of the Goſpel. Neither are they obtuſe, or ignorant in putting their Queſtions, but will ſmartly examine, and anſwer Logically, as if they were, Caſuiſts, concerning deep Myſteries in Divinity; inſomuch, that ſince</hi> Xaverius <hi>Landed here, which is now five Moneths, he hath been daily viſited by the</hi> Bonzi <hi>and the Laiety, Conferring from Morning till Midnight, asking and diſputing ſeveral Queſtions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning our Belief: Firſt,</hi> What God is?

The firſt ſhudder or ſhake was ſo vehement, that in leſs than half an hours ſpace, many hundreds were buried in the Rubbiſh of their own fallen Houſes. The faireſt Buildings firſt failed, coming to ground with horrible cracks; amongſt which, that ſtately Palace, the faireſt and largeſt that ever the Sun ſhin'd upon, which <hi>Taycoſama</hi> built, with ample Galleries, and ſuch ſpacious Courts, that therein they ſay he was able to Exerciſe a hundred and fifty thouſand Men.

All the way which they paſs'd was on a high Bank, verg'd with Rice-Fields ſo far as could be diſcern'd.

Moreover this Tree grows higher and thicker, according to the ſeveral Places it is Planted in. On the Mountains of <hi>Syria</hi> they grow ſo large-waſted, that four Men are ſcarce able to fathom one of them; but theſe have ſpiny and ſlender Bodies, conſidering their wondrous Height, whoſe lofty Crowns ſeem to mingle with the Clouds. <hi>Japan</hi> alſo produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Cedars, no ways inferior to thoſe: The Leaves thereof are ſoft and downy, but prickly at the ſharp ends. There is alſo a ſmall kind of Reſemblance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Cedar and the Juniper-Tree; but the Leaf of the laſt is longer and
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:34669:62"/>ſmaller, and grows nothing near ſo high; and the Wood thereof, being cut aſunder and us'd, is ſoon ſubject to rot: And alſo the Cedars are of a more fragrant ſmell, and bear a kind of Cod not unlike the Myrtle, which being open'd, hath four white Corns or Grains, like Rice, inclos'd in them; which when ripe, are of a deep yellow Colour; whereas the Juniper-berry is black, bitteriſh, and unpleaſant to the Palate.</p>

Theſe Trees either have continually Fruits or Bloſſoms on them: So that whilſt one Tree bears Bloſſoms or Green-fruit, the other Ripen. This Fruit being hot in Operation, helps all Coughs proceeding from cold De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluxions, the Cramp, opens obſtructed Uritories; and the Oyl thereof, if the Body be annointed therewith, defends it from the biting of Venomous Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Furthermore, the Cedar always flouriſheth, being conſtantly green; whoſe ſtately Branches run up in an exact Line, like the Trees themſelves; but if the Branches grow too heavy for them, the Body of the Tree commonly bends, growing crooked under the Burthen: The Cod which incloſes the Berries, when it begins to ripen, opens it ſelf, and in time of Rain or Miſts, drops off, leaving a round Stalk at the Boughs: This Stalk decays not till two Years after the dropping off of the Cod, which of it ſelf requires a whole Year before it becomes ripe, and this happens chiefly in Winter.</p>

Neither durſt he tarry long there, ſeeing the Walls totter, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he might ſuffer under the like Calamity, never ſtanding ſtill, till he got quite out of the City; all the way terrifi'd with imminent danger, Stones and pieces of Timber ſtill falling in a terrible manner, both before and behind him, the ground trembling under him, and gaping in ſeveral places about him, that hundreds of ſwallowing Gulfs appear'd in the Streets. Thus he, with ſix more of his Company, with much trouble and terror ſcap'd out of <hi>Rogouſa,</hi> lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing one by ſudden death in the way; but when they had clear'd themſelves of the Town, the Countrey prov'd no leſs difficult and dangerous, great heaps of torn up Rocks and Rubbiſh, filling the Paths, ſo that they being put to a ſtand, could find no way to get farther, whilſt looking behind them, they ſaw the City in ſeveral parts of fire, and three Store-houſes of Powder (a dreadful thing) when e're they catcht, would utterly deſtroy the miſerable remainder of thoſe yet alive.</p>
               <p>Thus for a night and a day this miſery laſted, without any intermiſſion, whilſt the people that eſcaped lay in the Fields, without either eating or drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and few of theſe that thus eſcaped, but were either hurt or ſtruck with ſickneſs, and had not a <hi>Venetian</hi> Ship that lay in the Harbor afforded them

               <p>
                  <hi>Van Dam</hi> at laſt got aboard of a Ship, where the terror was a little mitigated, a Magazine of Powder being very near, expecting every minute the blowing up; when two days after, on the eight of <hi>April,</hi> three hundred <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Moor-lacks</hi> on Horſes and Mules, deſcending from the Mountains, after ſome ſmall reſiſtance, entred the City, there making havock and bloody ſlaughter where e're they went; ſo clearing the way with a great booty gather'd up amongſt the Ruines, return'd.</p>
               <p>On the ſixth day, the Earthquake beginning to abate a little, <hi>Van Dam</hi> went towards the City, to look after his Goods, and ſeveral Preſents which the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador <hi>Crook</hi> had in cuſtody for the <hi>Grand Seignior.</hi>

               <p>When the Wife promiſes her departing Husband that ſhe will die with him, then ſhe muſt loſe no time; but the ſame day, where her Husband lies burning in the Funeral Pyre, ſhe muſt leap in, and be conſum'd with him.

The Walls are built of Freeze-ſtone, very high and thick, with Battlements on the tops: The outermoſt Wall is ſurrounded with a broad and dry Trench, and over the ſame a Bridge, with ſeveral Arches: The Gate made ſtrong with thick driven Iron Nails, is built four-ſquare, two Stories high; each Square or Story having a peculiar Roof, jetting ſeveral Foot over the Walls; on each ſide of the upper Square hang two long Flags or Pennons, with the Emperors Arms: The Gate is continually Guarded by a ſtrong Watch. Round about the inſide of the Out-wall are an innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable company of little Hovels, for the Soldiers: Theſe Huts are built exactly in a Line, and border a ſecond Moat, which is not without ſeveral Creeks, becauſe the ſecond Wall juts out in many Places, being a Bulwark, with many Towers, in all which are ſtrong Guards kept, as on the Out-wall. In the ſecond Gate is alſo a great Watch kept, to which joyns a third Trench,<note place="margin">Hath three Moats and Walls.</note> over which leads a fair Stone Bridge, at the end whereof a third Gate opens, between another Stone Wall, very ſumptuouſly built.</p>

               <p>For a defence againſt the Iſlanders, the Fort <hi>Colombo</hi> was well fortifi'd; yet it was not ſo ſtrongly built, but that it decay'd and fell to the Ground, which made <hi>Lupus Brittus</hi> to be ſent thither with ſeveral Workmen to repair the Fort; where arriving, and being buſie to prepare Mortar, Stones, and other Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries for the re-building, the <hi>Saracens</hi> again ſpurring up the <hi>Ceylonians</hi> againſt the <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> they a ſecond time Sally'd out upon them; but firſt the City <hi>Colomba</hi> refus'd to ſell the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Proviſions, after that they ſlew all thoſe that they found ſtragling from the Fort.

               <p>
                  <hi>Lucan</hi> alſo tells us, That the <hi>Egyptians</hi> had found out more than the <hi>Moretani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> had done heretofore; for they divided the Heavens with the Stars into
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:34669:107"/>twelve Houſes, in which Signs are ſeveral Conſtellations, look'd upon by their Learning, or help of Imagination, to perſonate, as fix'd there, ſeveral ſorts of Creatures, as Gods, Hero's, Men, Monſters, and ſeveral ſorts of Fiſhes. And therefore the <hi>Egyptians</hi> have divers Worſhips, for their Soothſayers us'd not onely the Planets, which are as their gods, but make their Reſponſes from the Configuration of the ſeveral Signs, which are inferior Creatures. Firſt,<note place="margin">Lucianus de Aſtrol.</note> they worſhip a Ram which they have from <hi>Aries:</hi> they touch no Fiſh which reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles the Sign <hi>Piſces;</hi> neither will they kill a Goat, becauſe of <hi>Capricorn;</hi> and the Bull, for the ſake of <hi>Taurus,</hi> they hold in the like eſtimation. The Apes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring a peculiar Worſhip, the Inhabitants Conſecrated a peculiar Prayer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lucan</hi> ſaith, That the <hi>Lybians</hi> worſhipp'd the famous <hi>Jupiter Ammon,</hi> in the manner of a Ram, as being one of the twelve Celeſtial Signs, to whom the <hi>Heathens</hi> came from all Parts to know future Events.</p>
               <p>Moreover, he ſaith ſome of theſe Worſhippers of Beaſts did not adore them as gods, but becauſe they were Conſecrated to their Deities, and for their good Deeds ſhewn either to the gods or men; and therefore at <hi>Delphis,</hi> according to <hi>Aelianus,</hi> a Wolf was religiouſly honor'd, becauſe he gave direction of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred ſtoln Gold, buried in the Mountain <hi>Parnaſſus.</hi>

               <p>

Therefore by reaſon of the great reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of Apes and Men, the <hi>Japanners</hi> are of opinion, and chiefly thoſe that believe the <hi>Pythagorean</hi> Doctrine concerning Tranſmigration, That the Souls of deceaſed Kings and Emperors reſide in Apes.</p>

During the <hi>Dayro's</hi> Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Japan</hi> never taſted the inconveniencies of a Civil War, which after his removal from the Throne,<note place="margin">Civil Wars were terrible in <hi>Japan,</hi> the reaſons there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</note> brake out in that nature, that ſcarce any Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey in the World was ever a greater Stage or Blood-ſhed: The ſalvage cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties which they us'd againſt one another, in that grand Commotion are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſſable; the Conquerors turn'd their new-gotten Provinces top-ſi-turvey, killing, not ſparing Infants in the Cradle, deſtroying and burning both Towns and Villages, of which ſome to this day lie bury'd in their own Rubbiſh, by which they ſufficiently teſtifie the Deſtructions which were made by their Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Wars, in which <hi>Japan</hi> was turmoil'd above fifty years.</p>
               <p>The occaſion and beginning was thus; The <hi>Dayro,</hi> who is accounted ſo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the Sun muſt not ſhine upon him, nor his Feet touch the Earth, nor his Hair or Nails ever ſuffer'd to be cut; (which Cuſtom hath been in uſe from many Ages to this day) had a hundred and eighteen years ago two Sons, of which the ſecond, according to an antient Law, ſupply'd the place of Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain-General, to be ready on all occaſions to quell all manner of Inſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, either by ſubſtitute Kings or Subjects.

Their Mother, out of her affections to both, prevail'd ſo far with the <hi>Dayro,</hi> that the General-ſhip ſhould be ſo divided betwixt both the Brothers, that they might Command their Forces Alternately, each his Trienial. But the youngeſt, when the time came that he ſhould Reſign his Commiſſion to his eldeſt Brother, refus'd, and privately choſe ſeveral Princes of <hi>Japan</hi> for to aſſiſt him if need ſhould require; by which means he Fortifi'd himſelf ſo ſtrongly, that he car'd for no Forces whatſoever, no, not his Father himſelf, who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately choſe another General, granting him Commiſſion, not onely to ſubdue, but kill his Rebellious Son.</p>
               <p>Soon after, ſeveral of his Subſtitute Kings raiſing all their Forces, brought a mighty Army together in the Field, with which they went on ſo ſucceſsfully, that in ſhort time, they utterly defeated and deſtroy'd the Rebel, and all his Forces.</p>

This was hard Labor, the Mountain being very ſteep and craggy; and his Maſter conſum'd daily much Fewel, who on a time had laid on more than he was us'd to do; which <hi>Toquixiro</hi> obſerving, took ſome of the
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:34669:122"/>Wood from the Fire, putting the remaining Sticks up in ſuch order, that a few of them caſt an exceeding great heat. His Maſter taking much notice of this his handſome contrivance, to make a greater and better Fire with much leſs Fewel, judg'd hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Servant was fitter for other Employment, than to be his Slave. Whereupon he not onely commended him, and freed him from his bad Service;<note place="margin">How he gets out of his Service, into the Emperors.</note> but giving him Money, bid him ſeek his Fortunes in the Wars, or elſewhere; not doubting, but the Gods had better things laid up in ſtore for him.</p>
               <p>Soon after this, <hi>Toquixiro</hi> began to have a more elevated opinion of himſelf, and his ſwelling Thoughts aiming at ſomething higher, he travel'd big with hopes to <hi>Meaco,</hi> where at firſt he got into the Service of a great Merchant, and ſoon after he was preferr'd to a Noble-man, a Prime Favorite of the Emperor <hi>Nobunanga's;</hi> who one day happening to go with the Emperor a Hawking, and <hi>Toquixiro</hi> being amongſt the Faulconers, and others of the Court-Retinue, it chanc'd that one of the beſt Hawks, flying at his Game, hung tangled about the Bough of a high Tree, by the Vervils; and when none of them were able to climb the Tree, <hi>Toquixiro's</hi> Maſter bid him ſee what he could do, which he perform'd ſo well, and with ſuch comely agility, and taking dexterity, that the like having not been ſeen before, the Emperor and all his Train admir'd the Man that ſo much out-did all the reſt, eſpecially <hi>Nobunanga</hi> himſelf; ſo that he took him into his Service, and preferring from place to place, he came to great Dignity; inſomuch that the reſt of the Courtiers that ſaw him riſe before them, and grow more and more in the Emperors favor, ſpited him extremely, their former Love turning into hatred, and never reſted contriving Plots, not onely to bring him down in his Pride and Greatneſs, but utterly to ruine him: When an Accident hapned pat for their purpoſe, which they were not negligent to lay hold on; and thus it was. A very rich Scymiter, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with Gold, which the Emperor highly eſteem'd, being ſtoln from the Court, and much inquiry after, his Enemies inſinuating, whiſper'd, that no body could ſteal it but <hi>Toquixiro,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Is accus'd with Theft.</note> having, as they ſaid, often prais'd, and taken more than common notice of it: This buzz'd about, his Greatneſs ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving left him few Friends to ſhake off the Aſperſion, it was the general Talk, and moſt of them being willing, believ'd; when an Intimate of his advis'd him to fly; for when once it came to the Emperors Ear, there was no way to avoid an ignominious Death. He being of a quick Apprehenſion, took his Friends Advice, and abſented; but he was no ſooner miſs'd, than his Enemies taking hold of the Advantage, made the Buſineſs no more doubtful, but all were ſatisfied, that he, and no other, was the Thief; the Emperor ſending every where to apprehend him, that he might receive condign Puniſhment for his ſo hainous Offence. Whilſt he thus abſconded, in a miſerable condition, fearing every minute to be taken, and ſo die without mercy, he ſecretly went up and down amongſt the Goldſmiths, inquiring cunningly after ſuch Plates as thoſe that were on the loſt Scymiter, as if he would buy ſuch Golden Plates: So by great accident he lighted upon them: Then with a kind of Authority, being a Courtier, he queſtion'd and threatned the Buyer; who frighted, to ſave his own Life, found the Seller, and ſo from hand to hand, at laſt the Thief himſelf;<note place="margin">Manifeſts innocence.</note> whom bringing to the Court, he was clearly acquitted of all, and had the honor to be Executioner himſelf;<note place="margin">Cuts off the Thieves Head.</note> ſo cutting off the Malefactors Head, laid it with the recover'd Plates at the Emperors Feet, who ſtraight re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving him into former Favor, ſtill advanc'd him the more, vexing thoſe by that means that had ſo falſly accus'd him.</p>
               <pb n="181" facs="tcp:34669:122"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Toquixiro</hi> at laſt obtaining to be a Governor,<note place="margin">Is made a Governor.</note> manag'd his Affairs with ſuch Moderation and Prudence, that he got the Love, Applauſe, and Eſtimation of all that were under his Concern, which ſtraight preferr'd him to a higher Place, and of more Dignity.</p>
               <p>¶ THe Impregnable Caſtle which held out againſt <hi>Nobunanga</hi> and all his Power, long after he was choſen Emperor, ſtill ſallying out with ſtrong and bold Parties, fetching in Booty, and often doing much damage and miſchief round about in ſeveral Places, now ſuppos'd altogether impoſſible to be taken in; <hi>Nobunanga</hi> conſidering the Activity and Subtlity of this his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorite, he thought once more to Attaque it:<note place="margin">Leads an Army into the Field.</note> So making <hi>Toquixiro</hi> General of the Forces appointed for that purpoſe, and Commiſſioning him at large, ſet him upon the Work, though with ſmall hopes of carrying ſo conſiderable a Buſineſs: But beyond his expectation, and all others that ſcoff'd at it, as a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous Undertaking, he behav'd himſelf ſo well, and ſhew'd himſelf ſo great a Maſter of Arms, that without much ado, what had remain'd a Goad ſo long in the Emperors ſide, and had baffl'd him ſo oft,<note place="margin">Takes the Caſtle of <hi>Nan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gafama.</hi>
                  </note> he took in.</p>
               <p>Thus the Emperor encourag'd with his Succeſs, ſent him out againſt the King of <hi>Amanguci,</hi> whom with the like good Fortune,<note place="margin">Subdues the King of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manguci.</hi>
                  </note> and without any great difficulty, he ſubdu'd. Thus being one of <hi>Nobunanga</hi>'s Chief Lieutenants, after his Defeat at <hi>Meaco,</hi> being ſlain in the <hi>Imperial-Blood-Grove,</hi> he took upon him the Authority of Protector of his third Son, an Infant of three Years old, whom he kept in a Caſtle, ſhewing him all poſſible Reverence, due to ſo hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and great a Prince: For <hi>Nobunanga</hi>'s eldeſt Son was ſlain with his Father, and the ſecond ran diſtracted.</p>
               <p>The Deceas'd Emperors Wives Brother, call'd <hi>Xibatadono,</hi> being the neareſt of his Relations left alive, ſtomach'd much at the Proceedings of <hi>Toquixiro,</hi> and oppos'd him in what he might; whom to remove, being ſuch a Block in his way, he reſolv'd, if poſſible, to deſtroy, and immediately ſat down and veſted the Fort wherein he reſided with a cloſe Siege. <hi>Xibatadono</hi> finding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf thus ſuddenly ſurpris'd, and ſo ſtraightned that there was no means left to eſcape, call'd a Council of all his Friends, thus ſaying, <hi>You all know our hard Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; and for my part, rather than yield to the cruel Tyrant, I am reſolv'd to end this wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Life by Self-ſlaughter: All my Requeſt is, That after Death,</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Xibatadono</hi> return'd them all Thanks for their Fidelity towards him: But before he took leave of this World, he made them a Funeral-Feaſt, loading his Tables with all Varieties, the Roofs reſounding with Vocal and Inſtrumental Muſique, ſuch as the Place afforded; Bowls of their beloved <hi>Chiaw,</hi> and Wine ſtill handed about. So after they had Treated to the height, they roſe, firſt fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Hall with Combuſtible Matter, as Bavins, Bruſh-wood, and the like, which firing, and the Flames at laſt aſcending through the Roof, then the bloody Banquet began. <hi>Xibatadono</hi> firſt fell upon his Wife and Children, and their Servants, running them through, or otherwiſe mortally wounding them; who was follow'd by the reſt of his Captains and Officers, in like manner diſpatching their Relations and Retinue: Then throwing their Bodies into the Flames, and ſtanding upon them, they ripp'd up their own Bowels.</p>

               <p>The Enemies Battering-Engines had by this time made Breaches in the Walls in ſeveral Places; three Towers undermin'd, alſo turn'd topſie-turvey: So that the City lay in a manner open and undefended, and the Soldiers which fill'd the Breaches were naked and without ſhelter, having neither Battlements nor Breaſt-works againſt which <hi>Hannibal</hi> drew up his whole Army. Hope ſpurr'd on the Aſſailants, and Deſparation kept the Defendants in their Stati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; ſo the Storm was very fierce, long, and well maintaind: <hi>Hannibal,</hi> if his Men did their parts, not doubting but to carry the City, made a fierce Aſſault; the <hi>Saguntines</hi> making good their Breaches with Throngs of Soldiers, match'd with equal Valour the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> in ſo cloſe a Body, that the Enemies Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows never miſt a Mark.</p>

               <p>Thus both Parties being tired, there hapned a ſhort Ceſſation: Onely the <hi>Saguntines</hi> labour'd day and night, to make up the Breaches of their ruin'd Walls.

                     <hi>Saguntus</hi> is divided in the middle.</note>But the <hi>Saguntines</hi> having divided the Town, rais'd a new Wall with the old Houſes.

The Buſineſs ſeeming thus to be finiſh'd, the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieg'd beſought that they might Treat with <hi>Hannibal</hi> concerning Peace: But the diſturb'd General was too much incens'd to give ear thereto; yet by the Entreaties of the <hi>Spaniard Alorcus,</hi> they obtain'd ſo much at laſt, that <hi>Hannibal</hi> would permit the <hi>Saguntines</hi> to depart, and inhabit in ſuch Countreys as he ſhould appoint for them; but that they ſhould leave all their Gold, Silver, and other Treaſures behind. With theſe Propoſals of Agreement <hi>Alorcus</hi> went

This occaſion'd a ſudden Alteration, which was agitated by a great Cry from the Fortification; for a Tower having been ſtorm'd and ſhaken a long time, fell to the Ground, which making a great Gap in the Walls, a whole Band of <hi>Africans,</hi> ſeeing the Guards fled to the Market-place, throng'd in: Of which <hi>Hannibal</hi> having ſudden notice, immediately enter'd the City, without any reſiſtance, with ſeveral thouſand Men: But the Citizens, in like manner as <hi>Xibatadono,</hi> in a moment ſet Fire on all their Houſes, chuſing rather to be burnt with their Wives and Children, than to be ſlain by <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi>'s Sword.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Toquixiro</hi> having Conquer'd <hi>Xibatadono</hi>'s Caſtle, he return'd to <hi>Meaco,</hi> where he not only chang'd his firſt Name <hi>Toquixiro,</hi> but alſo his ſecond, <hi>Faxiba,</hi> which <hi>Nobunanga</hi> had given him, calling himſelf <hi>Cambacun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dono,</hi> that is, <hi>Supreme Lord of Japan;</hi> and after that, <hi>Anno</hi> 1504. took upon him the Name of <hi>Taicoſama,</hi> that is, <hi>Mighty Emperor.</hi>

                  </note>¶ IT is alſo worthy our Obſervation, how the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> ſpread the Catholick Religion over moſt part of <hi>Japan: Xaverius</hi> began firſt, telling them of the Creation of the World, and how God had Created all things, and that the Son of God, in the fulneſs of time, had taken upon him Mans Nature, and Dy'd on the Croſs, was Bury'd, roſe again, and Aſcended up to Heaven, from whence he will come to Judge the Quick and the Dead. This Doctrine Tranſlated out of <hi>Portugal</hi> in the <hi>Japan</hi> Tongue, <hi>Xaverius</hi> read the eaſier to the <hi>Japanners,</hi> becauſe it was written in <hi>Portugal</hi> Characters.</p>

                  <hi>Coſmus Turianus,</hi> and <hi>Joannes Ferdinandez</hi> Preach'd moſt of the Miracles which Chriſt wrought, and taught the Auditors to make Croſſes with the right-hand, and to begin at the Head, <hi>In the Name of the Father;</hi> and ſo Sign themſelves down to the Breaſt, <hi>In the Name of the Son;</hi> and then from the left ſhoulder to the right, <hi>In the Name of the Holy Ghoſt:</hi> They alſo inſtructed them to Pray on Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands of Roſes, telling them over knob by knob, and ſaying, <hi>Jeſus Maria.</hi>

<pb n="246" facs="tcp:34669:155"/>that it was impoſſible to attain Salvation thereby:</q> When they underſtood this, then he told them, <q>That one God had Created all things of nothing, and made Men according to his own Image, to govern all: But the wicked that run headlong and wilfully to the Devil, had no ſhare therein; and that our Sins had brought Death upon us; and how Men were ſtill inclin'd to wickedneſs, acting againſt the Laws of God and Man, nay, againſt God himſelf; and ſince our Sins provok'd ſo Omnipotent a God, they deſerv'd Everlaſting Puniſhment: But the ſecond Perſon of the Holy Trinity had taken upon him Mans Nature in the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> to the end, he might in Mans Nature (which could onely ſuffer) die for our Sins a moſt cruel Death, and by reaſon of his God-head, prepar'd for us after this tranſitory Life, an Everlaſting Being, where there is the fulneſs of all Joys.</q> Then he explain'd them the Laws, Cuſtoms, and Myſteries of Baptiſm, and at laſt, anſwer'd the <hi>Bonzies</hi> to their ſeveral Contradictions, which they made againſt the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion.</p>

It is very well known, that the <hi>Japanners</hi> are of a quick apprehenſion, and much given to Diſputations, which the Jeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its found ſufficient teſtimonies of, by their ſeveral contradictions: When <hi>Xa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verius</hi> firſt Preach'd in <hi>Cangoxima,</hi> and amongſt other things, terrifi'd them with Hell, where the deceas'd (had it not been for our Saviours ſuffering) are conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually tormented in ſuch a nature, that after the expiration of many ages, they have no hope of any deliverance, or eaſe of their Torments, becauſe, that in the Flames they blaſpheme God, and ſuffer everlaſting Puniſhment for their ſinning againſt an Omnipotent Judge: Whereupon the <hi>Japanners</hi> reply'd, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <q>Do you, O <hi>Xaverius,</hi> place our Parents and Predeceſſors, Children and neareſt Relations in an unquenchable Fire? do thoſe burn there, that recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved their lives out of our Loins? do they die to live there for ever, and there live to be always dying, for whom if we had a thouſand lives, would wiſh to
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:34669:156"/>die as many times? are thoſe which brought us into the world tormented by Diabolical Fiends, without any ceſſation? cannot God help them? how can it then be poſſible, that he is Omnipotent? or will he not help them? how is it then that he is merciful? and what enjoyment can Heaven be to us, if we ſhould be tranſported thither through death, having ſo many Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, Children, Fathers and Mothers, who weep and roar continually for their inſufferable torments? And what Reaſons can there be given, that the merciful Creator ſhould take delight in puniſhing everlaſtingly the poor Creature?</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Xaverius</hi> tells us, That he convinc'd and reſolv'd them on all their Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Demands, but gives us no account with what Reaſons he ſatisfi'd them; onely he relates, that he ſhed abundance of Tears when he ſpake of the damn'd condition of the deceaſed <hi>Japanners.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover, when <hi>Xaverius</hi> told them, That there was a beginning of all things: they immediately reply'd, <q>That that beginning muſt be either good or evil, and did God create both good and bad at once? How can he be God, and confine all good in himſelf, and be the onely occaſion of all good out of himſelf? If he be good, from whence are theſe bad Devils? Did God create them bad? where then is his abundant goodneſs? Or did he give over thoſe to evil, which he could have kept from it? Was Man created to ſerve God in holineſs? why doth he ſuffer the Devil to tempt him to wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs? Why is Man left to himſelf, that cannot ſubſiſt without the Spirit of God? How can it alſo agree with Gods goodneſs, to create Men unable by their weakneſs, to be condemn'd for their ſins, and by their damnation for ever miſerable? And why are there ſuch Laws ordain'd, that no Creature on Earth is able to perform, the leaſt breach of which is eternal damnation? inſomuch that upon neceſſity the whole Race of Mankind, by the power of that Law, muſt be curſed, he being born in ſin. The <hi>Japan</hi> Religion was eſtabliſh'd on better grounds of Gods Mercy, in that they had no everlaſting Hell. The Worſhippers and Servants of <hi>Amida, Xaca, Canon,</hi> and other <hi>Japan</hi> gods, exchanged by death their tranſitory Life for everlaſting Salvation: and if it happen'd that after death they ſuffer'd ſome torments for their ſins committed in this Life, that continu'd but a ſhort time, according to the Crime.</q>

                  </note>Beſides theſe two former, there is a third Reaſon why the <hi>Chriſtian Faith</hi> took ſo ſoon footing in <hi>Japan,</hi> which was the ignorance of the <hi>Japanners</hi> in Natural Philoſophy; for which cauſe they were much amazed when the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> told them concerning the Weather, and all ſorts of Meteors; How that the Fire which was either kindled in the Air, or Creviſes of the Earth, made horrible Repreſentations; That the Air, or Region under the Moon produced flying Sparks, flaming Torches, burning Lamps, and falling Stars; That in the Harveſt-time, when the Earth is neither Frozen by extremity of Cold, nor dry'd up by exceſs of Heat, abundance of Vapors ariſe, which cauſe thoſe <hi>Ignes fatui,</hi> or as the Vulgar call it, <hi>Jack with a Lantern.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The <hi>Jeſuits</hi> teach them Philoſophy to their great admiration.</note> They declared alſo the Generation and ſignifications of Comets, that when they appear'd bloody, duskiſh, or bright, with a long Tail, they either ſignifi'd Drought, exceſs of Heat, Storms, Earthquakes, Famine, or Deluges. And likewiſe they decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the occaſion of Thunder and Lightning: whereof ſome being inclos'd in the Clouds, doth rattle and make a noiſe onely; other breaks forth, battering all that they meet with, or ſet it on fire; and that in the Night it Lightned more frequently than in the Day-time, and chiefly in the heat of Summer. They told them the reaſon of the appearing of Rain-bowes, whether they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the Sun or Moon, and though commonly appearing after Rain, yet muſt be look'd upon as a Divine Token, that God will no more deſtroy the whole World in a general Deluge. Moreover, they ſhew'd the reaſon of the opening of the Skie, and Circles about the Moon; That white Clouds, and alſo red in the Evening, were ſigns of fair Weather, but in the Morning foreſhew'd Storms, and abundance of Rain; That the Clouds, which were the Receptacles of Thunder, bred Rain; and beſides Water, alſo ſometimes ſent down, to the admiration of Men, Milk, Blood, Frogs, Stones, and ſuch like. They alſo taught, That Snow was a thin Cloud, which in the falling Freezeth into that Nature as it comes upon the Earth; That Hail detaining ſome warmth, is ſooner ſubject to Cold; but the higher it Congeals and Freezes in the Air, the ſmaller it is, and the lower the bigger, and chiefly in the Summer-time, becauſe of the great difference betwixt Cold and Heat. They inform'd them with the occaſions of Dew, Miſts, Fogs, and Ice; That a timely Thaw and Mizling Rain brought great Profit; That the Heat in Winter, remaining in the Caverns of the Earth, preſerved all manner of Roots, and that the Dew in the Summer moiſtens the Ground, and nouriſhes the Plants; whereas otherwiſe the Sun would ſcorch the Graſs and other Products, and untimely Froſts kill the early Buds.

It is very ſeldom but they find one or other that will disburſe Money for them, upon giving them a Note, not without promiſe of great Intereſt. So ſoon as they have thus fill'd their Purſes, they return with the Booty back to their Cloyſters: For which cauſe,<note place="margin">Are every where kili'd, if known.</note> if the <hi>Neugori</hi> from <hi>Fatonochaiti</hi> are known any where, they are without mercy Ston'd to death.

Every one contributes to the Maintenance of his Chappel and Prieſt to which he belongs; for every Sect of the <hi>Bonzi</hi> have their Congregation. They never trouble each other about Differences of Religion; nay, the Citizens never diſpute about their Opinions in matter of Faith, though their ſeveral Sects differ much one from another.</p>
               <p>Moſt of their Temples are Houſes of Good-fellowſhip; for which reaſon, many of them are built in the moſt delightful Places; where they come often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times together,<note place="margin">The Recreation of the <hi>Bonzi.</hi>

               <p>God repreſents in this ſmall Animal the exact Image of Vertue; wherefore the Holy Scripture admoniſhes the Slothful to take Example by them. And indeed their Care is exceeding great; for they make their Neſt with ſo many crooked Entrances, that it is ſecure from all hurtful Creatures: The Earth which they ſcrape out, they ſtop before their Holes, to keep out Rain: Theſe Holes are divided into three Partitions; in one the Males and Females live to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; in another the Females breed up their Young; and the third ſerves them for their Storehouſe, wherein they lay their Proviſion.</p>

               <p>During this Diſcourſe, Captain <hi>Schaep,</hi> the Merchant, and the Youth, were led to a ſpacious Gallery from the other People, where <hi>Sicungodonne</hi> and <hi>Sabro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaimondonne</hi> ſat in State, having juſt before been buſie about Trying of Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners for their Lives: But being ſet down before the two Lords, they were ask'd nothing of any conſequence; only each of them being commanded to drink a Cup of Wine, they had leave to return to their Lodgings.

               <p>Cloſe by the City is a great Palace about the bigneſs of a ſmall City, which entring, after having paſt ſeveral Avenues, they came before a diſmal and dark Priſon; before the Grates of which the four condemned <hi>Jeſuits</hi> ſat loaden with great Fetters and Chains, with ſome other <hi>Japan Chriſtians;</hi> from thence they were conducted into a ſpacious open Court, in which ſtood Gibbets, Croſſes, Gallows, and great Wells full of Water. The Place ſwarm'd with People, and chiefly one Leaded Entry Pav'd with Free-ſtone, was continually full of all manner of Courtiers, private Officers, Executioners and Hang-men, which paſſed to and again, expecting Commands. At laſt the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> and the <hi>Japanners</hi> were brought out of their Dungeon, to come before the chief Magiſtrate of <hi>Japan.</hi> And whilſt the Judges were buſie in examining them, moſt part of the Day was ſpent: Mean while the <hi>Hollanders</hi> ſtood in the open Court next the Guards, which had brought them from their Inn thither, where they ſaw all Paſſages; and that they might not faint in ſo great a Crowd, they had Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meats given them to eat; which they judg'd was by <hi>Sicungodonne's</hi> order. At laſt they were led through a ſmall Gate, to a very pleaſant Place, having on one ſide a Woodden Gallery cover'd with Mats; through which paſſing and entring into a Princely Hall, they were commanded to kneel before <hi>Sicungo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donne,</hi> ſitting on a high Throne ſurrounded with a great number of Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, who by the Interpreters ask'd the <hi>Hollanders</hi> theſe following Queſtions:</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Queſtions ask'd the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers,</hi> to which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn Anſwers,</note>From whence, whither, and when they put to Sea? Why they Anchor'd in the Haven <hi>Namboe?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Hollanders</hi> anſwer'd, That they ſet Sail the third of <hi>February, Anno</hi> 1643. from the Road before <hi>Batavia,</hi> and ſteer'd their Courſe towards <hi>Ternata,</hi> from whence they weighed Anchor the fourth of <hi>April;</hi> but afterwards driven by great Storms, were neceſſitated to Anchor in the Haven <hi>Namboe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then <hi>Sicungodonne</hi> ask'd them if they were <hi>Christians,</hi> though no <hi>Papiſts?</hi> If they did not deſire to ſpeak with the four <hi>Jeſuits</hi> in private?</p>
               <p>Their Anſwer hereupon was, That they were <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> but no <hi>Papiſts;</hi> and
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:34669:205"/>believe in one God, Creator and Governor of Heaven and Earth; for which Religion they were ready to die; and had nothing to ſay to the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> but held them for their greateſt Enemies.</p>
               <p>The other Queſtions which they were ask'd were theſe following:</p>
               <p>How many <hi>Netherlanders, Chineſes,</hi> and others, liv'd in <hi>Batavia?</hi> Where their Governor kept his Court? How many Ships hath he in his Service? What Places do they Sail to? Do all manner of Artificers live in <hi>Batavia?</hi> Do Shoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers, Taylors, Weavers, and other Handicrafts reſide there?</p>
               <p>The <hi>Hollanders</hi> told them, That there liv'd about twelve hundred <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> in <hi>Batavia,</hi> beſides three thouſand <hi>Chineſes,</hi> and a conſiderable number of <hi>Malabars, Javans, Bandaneeſen, Amboiners,</hi> and <hi>Mardikers,</hi> and alſo all manner of Handicrafts, reſided in the City: but the number of the Ships which Sailed to <hi>Perſia, Ceylon, Cormandel, Malacca, Siam, Molucco-Iſlands, Tayoan,</hi> and other Places from <hi>Batavia,</hi> was unknown to them.</p>
               <p>They were alſo ask'd, If the <hi>Hollanders</hi> ſaw any way by which they might Conquer <hi>Nangeſaque,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Are ſilent in one Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.</note> as they had done <hi>Quilang?</hi> But making as if they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood them not, this Queſtion was not anſwer'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sicungodonne</hi> enquir'd of them alſo, Why their Ketch <hi>Breskens</hi> had fir'd her Guns ſeveral times in the Haven of <hi>Namboe,</hi> which had frighted the Fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and all the Countrey People thereabouts? Alſo if they had not a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter aboard?</p>
               <p>The <hi>Hollanders</hi> acknowledg'd, That the hady fir'd with bare Powder on the intreaty of ſome <hi>Japan</hi> Gentlemen which came Aboard of them to view the Ship; and that they had not the leaſt intentions to ſcare the People, which they not once thought of, being accuſtom'd to do the ſame before <hi>Firando,</hi> when any Gentlemen deſir'd it: but out of fear they deny'd that they had a Miniſter Aboard.</p>
               <p>At laſt they were ask'd if they could not ſwim, as they had ſeen many <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> do at <hi>Nangeſaque?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Queſtion amaz'd them much, not knowing why they ſhould ask it; yet they reply'd, That ſome could ſwim, and others not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sicungodonne</hi> leaving off to make any farther Examination, gave the <hi>Hollanders</hi> leave to go to their Lodgings; where they reſted till the three and twentieth of <hi>September,</hi> without any farther moleſtation. Then the Secretary told them, that their Landlord was gone to the Lord <hi>Sicungodonne</hi>'s Houſe, to ask for ſome Clothes for them, becauſe the cold Weather began to pinch, and they were us'd to go warm Cloth'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sicungodonne</hi> promis'd to furniſh them with Coats. He alſo ſignifi'd, that the impriſon'd <hi>Jeſuits</hi> and <hi>Japanners,</hi> not being able to endure the exquiſite Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, had deny'd <hi>Chriſtianity.</hi>

               <p>The next day the Interpreters <hi>Kitsbioye</hi> and <hi>Fatſioſaimon,</hi> with the Renegado Prieſt <hi>Siovan,</hi> came and brought for every <hi>Hollander</hi> two <hi>Japan</hi> Coats made of Cotton by <hi>Sicungodonne</hi>'s Order.

An enemy may be repuls'd by high Bulwarks, and inacceſſible Ways; againſt great Storms, Harbors are ſure Guards; Fire follows not thoſe which flye from it; raging Sickneſs, though it empties Cities, yet ſwallows them not up: but the Earthquakes hide oftentimes under heaps of Rubbiſh, or almoſt bottomleſs Pits, Mountains, Cities, nay, whole Territories, without leaving the leaſt Mark behind; ſo that whole Generations of People are buried with the Ruines of their Habitations.</p>

The <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panners</hi> (as we ſaid before) aſcribe it to the Water, or rather (according to their Cuſtom and idle Fancies) to a Sea-Monſter. But thoſe that aſcribe it to the Water, differ in their Opinions: Some maintain (according to <hi>Thales Mileſius</hi>) that the Earth ſwims upon the Sea, and is moved by it almoſt like a Ship.

               <p>But <hi>Anaxagoras</hi> judges the Earth it ſelf to be the reaſon of her own unfirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; for he ſaith that it is nothing without which moves it, but great Pieces within falling, either looſned by moiſture, or conſum'd by Fire; or the Winds which rage under Ground, blown down, or elſe being decay'd by Age, like an old Building, of which the Foundation being rotted, and not able to bear the Superſtructure, tumble down.

Furthermore, our Order was from the <hi>Indian</hi> Council at <hi>Batavia,</hi> That when we came ſo far as our Maps directed us, which is to thirty nine Degrees, and Weather'd the utmoſt North-Point of <hi>Japan;</hi> then to Steer according to the Globe, of which we had two in the Ship, and ſo to make a Map of our own Diſcoveries, Steering North-Weſt to find <hi>Tartary,</hi> in forty five Degrees.</p>

They an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd, That they would gladly be ready; though in their Hearts they ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected Danger, becauſe they were commanded to appear ſo ſoon, which they had never done before. But at the appointed time, going thither accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with the four Interpreters, the Apoſtate Prieſt <hi>Syovan,</hi> their Landlord, and his Son, they ſtaid above an Hour waiting in a Princely Hall, which look'd out into an exceeding pleaſant Garden: But being carried out of this Hall to the uſual Waiting place, they ſtaid till Noon. Mean while <hi>Sicungodonne</hi>'s Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary treated them with Pieces of Bread, and two Cups of Wine apiece; and being carried into the Place of Audience, they were commanded to ſit down on Mats by four <hi>Jeſuits,</hi>

                  </note> who look'd exceeding pitifully; their Eyes and Cheeks ſtrangely fallen in; their Hands black and blew; and their whole Bodies ſadly miſus'd and macerated by Torture. This Company amaz'd the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> who were not able to judge the Reaſon of their being plac'd by the four <hi>Jeſuits.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe, though they had Apoſtatiz'd from the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Faith, yet declar'd publickly to the Interpreters <hi>Kytsbyoye</hi> and <hi>Phatſyoſamon,</hi> That they did not freely Apoſtatize; but the inſufferable Torments which had been inflicted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, had forc'd them to it. The Council ask'd them at large concerning their Opinions, and the Power of God; on which one anſwer'd faintly, but the reſt were much more reſolute.</p>

                  <q>O deſpairing <hi>Jeſuits!</hi> What Confidence can you repoſe in your God, who hath ſo ſhamefully forſaken you? Is he the Creator and Governor or all Things? Why doth he not releaſe you from your Troubles, by which your Bodies ſeem rather to be Anatomies than Living Creatures? Cannot the <hi>Japan</hi> Emperor do with you whatever he pleaſes, without asking leave of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> God? One of the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> anſwer'd; "It is apparent that God hath forſaken us in this World, as the Children thereof; yet he hath never forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken thoſe that truſt in him, becauſe he helps us in our greateſt Extremities, when a tortur'd Perſon is not ſenſible of his Pain, the Soul being rapt with Heavenly Contemplations; and conſiders, that theſe Temporal Torments laſt no longer than Life.</q> The third <hi>Jeſuit</hi> ſaid; <q>God viſits us, for our ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold Sins, with great and ſeveral Afflictions; yet the Soul remains un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touch'd by any Executioner. When the Soul leaves the Body, ſhe goes to Purgatory, where (though not without great pain) ſhe is long cleanſed and purified, till ſhe is fit to go to a Heavenly <hi>Elizium,</hi> there to enjoy all Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. God therefore forſakes not his Children, becauſe he brings them to Everlaſting Life, notwithſtanding the way thither is very troubleſom. It is true, that theſe poor and miſerable Bodies are in the Emperor's Power, which he would not have, were it not granted him from God: Alſo all Humane Authority ceaſes over Man, when the Soul is departed out of the Body. The laſt <hi>Jeſuit</hi> concluded the propos'd Queſtions after this manner; Without the True God, is no Salvation; and without his Will and Permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, nothing either good or bad can be done.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Japan</hi> Council not well experienc'd in the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion, wanted Queſtions to ask them, and therefore call'd for <hi>Syovan</hi> the Apoſtate Prieſt, who was there ready for that purpoſe. So ſoon as he ſaw the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> he look'd very
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:34669:217"/>fiercely upon them, notwithſtanding he had formerly been one of their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and in a ſcoffing manner laid,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Syovan</hi> deſpiſes the <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits</hi> very ſhrewdly.</note>
                  <q>Now fie upon you <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> that make this World in an Uproar. How you vapor of your God and Salvation? Are none ſav'd but <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> or thoſe that embrace your Opinion? In what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts your Intereſt in Heaven? Is it becauſe you privately diſſemble with, and defraud all Princes; and gathering, hoard up the Worlds Treaſure? Had you remain'd ſtill in your uſual Pleaſures, the <hi>Japan</hi> Priſons had not har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor'd ſuch a crue of Antichriſts; nay, <hi>Japan</hi> had never ſhed ſo much Blood: for thouſands, by your Deluſions, were taken from their Worſhip of the ancient Gods <hi>Amida, Xaca,</hi> and <hi>Canon,</hi> and embrac'd the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion, for which they ſuffer'd the cruelleſt Deaths. Was it under a pretence to win Souls? Why did you then carry ſo many Tun of Gold yearly out of <hi>Japan?</hi> And why did you plot to bring <hi>Japan</hi> under the Subjection of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Tyrant, and ſo to order all things according to your pleaſure? But now, what is the Power of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> God? Look upon your miſerable Bodies; can he not help you? Where then is he Omnipotent? Will he not help you? Where is his Mercy? O fooliſh thought of Salvation! You are diſtracted, to continue thus in your ſtubborn humor, imagining to receive great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards from God, and great Eſteem of your Succeſſors, in ſuffering wilfully your Bodies to be thus tormented. I ask once again, Why doth not your God help you? Certainly your Life is not in his Hands, but in the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of <hi>Japan,</hi> who when he pleaſeth can puniſh and torture you more than ever he hath done yet.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This the <hi>Hollanders</hi> underſtood very well, becauſe <hi>Syovan</hi> ſpoke with a loud Voice; and they alſo were us'd to his Stile, by reaſon of their converſation with him in their Inn.<note place="margin">To the great satisfaction of the Council.</note> But whilſt <hi>Syovan</hi> rail'd thus at the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> he ſeem'd exceedingly to pleaſe two of the <hi>Japan</hi> Council, <hi>Sackay Sammoccyſame,</hi> and <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſodairo Yſoſſamma,</hi> with his Diſcourſe, and chiefly when he ſpoke of <hi>Amida</hi> and <hi>Xaca.</hi>

               <p>¶ IT is worthy our Obſervation, that not only the <hi>Japanners,</hi> but alſo all other <hi>Heathens,</hi> nay, ſuch <hi>Pagans</hi> that acknowledg'd one God, yet gave not Divine Honor to the very true God: For underſtanding by the Light of Nature, that there muſt upon neceſſity be a God, that Created Heaven and Earth, and requir'd to be Worſhipp'd, they aſcrib'd the Godhead to the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; not unlike the blind Man,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>John</hi> 9. <hi>v.</hi> 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.</note> of which St. <hi>John</hi> the Evangeliſt makes men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for he, when he ſaw the Son of God, of whom he had receiv'd ſight, ask'd him, who was Gods Son? becauſe him whom he ſaw, he knew not who he was.<note place="margin">Ignorance of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents concerning God, and eſpecially the <hi>Japanners.</hi>
                  </note> So in like manner all the <hi>Heathens</hi> look to this day on the Inviſible God, openly in his Viſible Works: They hear him calling with a loud, yet ſilent Voice, <hi>I am the Creator of the World, the Preſerver and Governor, to whom all Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Worſhip belongs:</hi> But they ſhut their Eyes from ſeeing, and ſtop their Ears from hearing, no otherwiſe than if they dream'd; and following their own Imaginations, put the Viſible Creature in the place of the Inviſible Creator. And ſo the <hi>Japanners</hi> acknowledge a God; and yet <hi>Amida, Xaca, Canon,</hi> and other Idols (whoſe Beginning and Original they deny not) they give Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Honor to.</p>
               <p>But this Error is very ancient: The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith thus of the <hi>Heathens; Profeſsing themſelves to be wiſe,</hi>

                  <hi>they became ſools: And chang'd the Glory of the uncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible God, into an Image made like to corruptible Man, and to Birds, and four-footed
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:34669:217"/>Beaſts, and Creeping things. Wherefore God alſo gave them up to uncleanneſs, through the luſts of their own hearts, to diſhonor their own Bodies between themſelves: Who chang'd the Truth of God into a Lie, and worſhipp'd and ſerv'd the Creature more than the Creator, who is bleſſed for ever, Amen.</hi> Gods Truth is chang'd into Lies, when Divine Worſhip is ſhewn to any thing but to the real God: For it is a Truth, That there is a God; and to ſay that the Creature is God, is a Lie.</p>

                  </note>¶ THey were poſſeſs'd with theſe melancholy Thoughts, when on a ſudden the Earth was ſhaken, the Timbers and Roofs of Houſes tumbling down to the Ground, the Walls falling one towards another, and much harm in thoſe places where the Motion was greateſt.</p>

               <p>Moreover there are reckon'd three ſorts of Earthquakes. The greateſt is a Gaping, which often ſwallows up Houſes, Villages, whole Countreys, and Iſlands. The great Lakes and bottomleſs Waters in <hi>Japan,</hi> hide under them formerly famous Places and People, and thereby teſtifie enough how this Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire is plagu'd by ſuch Evils. For the ſecond, the Learned reckon that which ſhakes the Earth, heaving it up and down, and ſhakes that which is on the top thereof, in ſuch a manner, that all things tremble and fall down. The third and ſmalleſt is, when the Ground moves to and again, like a Boat on the Waves. Such a one was this that hapned at <hi>Jedo</hi> whilſt the <hi>Hollanders</hi> were there.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The fore-running Signs thereof.</note>It hath alſo often before, as well as now, been obſerv'd, That a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Earthquake the Air was very calm, the Winds being lock'd in the Boſom of: the Earth: The Air is alſo colder than at other times it us'd to be in that Seaſon of the year, which hinders the breaking forth of the Winds: There likewiſe appear'd a long thin Cloud in the Sky: The Sea rag'd ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly, notwithſtanding there was no Wind ſtirring: All Pools and ſand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Waters ſtunk very much; and the Water it ſelf taſted of Brimſtone.</p>
               <p>This the Learned <hi>Gerard Voſsius</hi> aſcribes to the Fire which is under Ground, and lies hid in deep places, under Mountains, Iſlands, and Seas, by which the Earth alſo is ſhaken many Miles together; ſo that not only, Cities, Villages, Territories, but whole Countreys, are totter'd, and turn'd topſie-turvey by it.</p>
               <p>This Fire vomits out many ſulphurous and burning Vapors, which Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence hath taught us, becauſe the Earth often rending aſunder in Earthquakes, ſends forth hideous Flames. The Fountains alſo ſmell ſulphury, becauſe the Spirits aſcending, mix themſelves with the Water.</p>
               <p>By this Sign <hi>Phracides,</hi> Maſter to <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> the <hi>Lacedemonian,</hi> foretold of an approaching Earthquake, which he judg'd would be terrible,<note place="margin">

               <p>Hereto is added, That the Countreys in which Burning Mountains are found, are moſt ſubject to ſuch Damages. <hi>Joſephus Acoſta</hi> relates the like of <hi>America;</hi> and our daily Experience of <hi>Campania, Sicily,</hi> and other Places, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Mountains either vomit forth continual Smoke, or hideous Flames, confirms this Opinion.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Sicily</hi> is at the preſent leſs troubled with Earthquakes than formerly, becauſe the Vent or Hale of Mount <hi>Aetna</hi> being burnt wider and wider, affords a freer Paſſage to the Vapors and the Fire.</p>

                  <hi>And King</hi> Solomon <hi>made two hundred Targets of beaten Gold: ſix hundred Shekels of Gold went to one Target. And he made three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Shields of beaten Gold, three Pound of Gold went to one Shield; and the King put them in the Houſe of the Foreſt of</hi> Lebanon. <hi>Moreover the King made a great Throne of Ivory, and overlaid it with the beſt Gold. The Throne had ſix Steps, and the top of the Throne was round behind: and there were Stays on either ſide on the place of the Seat, and two Lions stood beſide the Stays. And twelve Lions ſtood thereon, on the one ſide and on the other, upon the ſix Steps: there was not the like made in any Kingdom. And all King</hi> Solomon<hi>'s Drinking-Veſſels were of Gold, and all the Veſſels of the Houſe of the Foreſt of</hi> Lebanon <hi>were of pure Gold, none were of Silver, it was nothing account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of in the days of</hi> Solomon.</p>
               <p>But though <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Riches and Splendor could not be parallell'd in thoſe Times; yet were he now in being, he could not compare to the <hi>Japan</hi> Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror.

               <p>Along the inner Wall of the Court ſtand ſtately Watch-houſes, built like Galleries. In the Front thereof hangs the Emperors Flag, under which ſtands a Pike-man, who keeps Sentinel.

               <p>At the Gate ſtand two of the Emperor's Deputy-Secretaries, which write down and take an account of every Piece of what ſhall be ſhewn to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror; which done, they are put into the Store-houſes that joyn next the Gate, which are built ſecure againſt all Fire. On the corners of the Roofs lie Couch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant Dragons, all gilded, whoſe foremoſt Feet lye upon Golden Balls. Here is generally great crowding; ſome carrying the Preſents in, others carrying them out, and others putting them in good order in the Store-houſes. Through the ſaid Portal appears the Rail, by which the Imperial Throne is ſeparated from the open Court. One ſide of the Throne is guarded by Musketeers, and the other by Pike-men. Juſt before the Throne is a large and ſpacious Field, about which ſtand high Watch-Towers, built on the Out-wall of the third inner Court. Next the Towers are ſtately Gates, both ſides thereof guarded with Watch-houſes, built long-ways on ſquare Pillars.

Before every Tower is a Watch-houſe, ſhut round about: The lower Edges of the Roof are adorn'd with Golden Balls. In this place the Chief of the Nobility keep Watch. On the ſides you walk through the Gates of the ſecond Inner-Court. The Emperor ſits under a Pent-houſe of his Banquetting-Turret, from which a Way through a Door leads to the Throne, whoſe Supporters on both ſides, and upper parts, are adorn'd with curious Imagery of maſſie Gold. Right before the Door, behind the Emperor, ſit four Lords, which are neareſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied to him in Blood: As many of the Chief Council ſtand on the right ſide

               <p>Who hath not heard of the famous Pyramids, which were the Burying-pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for the Kings of <hi>Egypt?</hi> of which three are yet remaining: The greateſt is ſquare, and runs up ſloaping; yet on the top ſo broad, that there may ſtand fifty Men: The breadth from one corner to another, at the bottom, being three hundred twenty four Paces, and riſing aloft with two hundred and fifty Steps, every Step five Foot high, and each Foot nine Inches long. At each of the four Corners is a low Deſcent, to which none can go but ſtooping. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Belloon</hi> relates, That he found this Pyramid, <hi>Anno</hi> 1548. built within after this manner: Creeping through a narrow Paſſage, with a Wax Candle in his Hand, he came into an empty Room, where turning on the left Hand, they found a ſpacious Place, to which a curious Gallery led the way: The Gallery was pav'd with great Free-ſtones, curiouſly poliſh'd, without Steps, ſo that he was forc'd to ſupport himſelf by the Rails on both ſides, after which man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner he aſcended ſixteen Paces; at the end of which appear'd a handſom ſquare Chamber, in which ſtood a Cheſt of twelve Foot long, five high, and as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny broad, without a Cover, hewn out of one entire piece of black Marble, wherein the <hi>Egyptian</hi> King lay Interr'd that built this Pyramid: Beſides theſe, he found ſeveral other Apartments, and alſo a Well fill'd with Stones.</p>
               <p>Moreover, the <hi>Athenians</hi> made ſo much ado about the Burying of their Dead, that they condemn'd ten Commanders, becauſe they neglected to do that Office to two departed Soldiers.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Hebrews</hi> neglected not to bury their Enemies.</p>

               <p>It is certain, that the <hi>Romans</hi> have not always burnt their Dead; for their ancient Law commanded, <hi>Bury none in the City, nor burn none.

                  <note place="margin">Their remarkable and ſtrange Ceremonies uſed about the Dead.</note>The <hi>Roman</hi> Pride in thoſe Affairs, the <hi>Japanners</hi> have taken an exact Pattern by: for when a Perſon dies, they ſet the Corps on a Bier, with his Head bow'd forwards, and his Hands folded together, in a praying Poſture, clad in
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:34669:239"/>White, over which hangs a Paper Coat, paſted together, whereon is written the Religion of that Idol whom the deceas'd honor'd and worſhipp'd. In this poſture four Men carry it out of the City to the Fire; then a great number of his Relations and Friends, which attended the Corps, ſtand round about the Fire, and call a whole Hour together on the Name of the Idol, whether <hi>Amida, Xaca, Canon,</hi> or any other, to whoſe Service in his Life-time the Departed was moſt devote; whilſt the <hi>Bonzies</hi> play, making a horrible noiſe, by ſtriking on Copper Kettles and Baſons. The Pit wherein the Fire is made, is ſquare, hung round about with Mats, and hath an Entrance that opens towards the four Winds: The Pit it ſelf fill'd full of Wood, which is cover'd with a Sail. On both ſides thereof ſtand Tables, fill'd with Meats, all dreſs'd in Blood, and Veſſels fill'd with Perfumes; and next them, lie great Heaps of Sweet-wood. When the Bier with the Corps approaches, they faſten a long Rope about it, on which every one that can come near lays his Hand, and call all together on the Name of the Deceaſed's Idol. Thus they carry the Body three times about the Pyre, on the Shoulders of four Men: At laſt ſetting the Bier with the Corps on the Pile of Wood, the chief <hi>Bonzie</hi> waves a lighted Torch three times over the dead Bodies Head; which done, he throws it away; but it is taken up again by the neareſt of the Deceaſeds Relations, of which one ſtands on the Eaſt, and the other on the Weſt ſide of the Bier. Three times they give it from one to the other over the Corps; then they ſet Fire on the Pile of Wood, whilſt others that ſtand next to them pour Oyl and Eſſences thereon; ſo that the Flame ſuddenly aſcends the Sky, and conſumes the dead Body to Aſhes.</p>
               <p>Mean while, the Children and neareſt Relations go to the Tables, kindle the Veſſels with Perfumes, and ſhew Worſhip to him that is burnt: Which done, every one returns home; onely the Common People that follow'd the Corps, make themſelves merry about the Fire, with the Meat that ſtands on the two Tables by the Funeral Pit.</p>
               <p>The next day the neareſt Allies return again to the Fire, and there gather the Aſhes, Teeth, and Bones into a gilded Urn, which carrying home, they ſet in a private Chamber, and cover with a rich Cloth. Seven days together they mourn, accompanied all the time with ſome of the <hi>Bonzies,</hi> who receive great Rewards for the time they ſpend in ſuch Services. On the ſeventh day the gilded Urn is Interr'd without the City, in the place where the Body was burnt; which done, they ſpare no Coſt nor Charges in erecting a ſtately Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument.</p>

On every corner of the Altar ſtands a flat Diſh; onely behind the Idol, towards the right ſide, ſtands a deep Platter, in which Perfumes are continually burnt. The Plates ſerve to hold the Money which the People offer. In the middle, <hi>Jene</hi> ſits on a round Scollop'd Cuſhion, being repreſented with four Bearded Faces, the Heads whereof are all joyn'd together behind: He wears a Golden Crown, with ſeven Spires, on whoſe tops are round Balls full of Diamonds. On his Breaſt hangs a double String of Pearls, and at the end thereof a Roſe of Diamonds: His left Arm he holds aloft, and his folded Hand graſps a Staff, which he ſticks into a Sun: From this Arm hangs a ſecond downwards, in the Hand holding a pleited Garland.

                  </note>The <hi>Chineſes</hi> and <hi>Japanners</hi> obſerve chiefly, that the Brides and Bridegrooms differ not much in their Age, Eſtate, and Extract. The Betrothed are in the Morning early carry'd in coſtly Coaches, drawn either by Oxen or Horſes from their Houſes out of the City, accompanied with all manner of Vocal and Inſtrumental Muſick to a high Hill, attended by a great number of People, and ſometimes are ſo crowded, that they are forc'd to have Soldiers with them to clear the Way: After the Bridegroom's Coach<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> follow ſeveral Wayns loaden with Preſents, with which he buys the Bride. Which Manner they have like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe brought out of <hi>China:</hi> for there the Man gives to the new marry'd Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man divers Marriage Goods; which ſhe delivers to her Father or Mother, as a requital for the bringing of her up; ſo that the chief Riches increaſe from the number of their Daughters, and chiefly when they are beautiful.</p>
               <p>The antient <hi>Babylonians</hi> bringing their Daughters to Market at a certain time of the year, ſold them to thoſe that proffer'd moſt: the Price was ſet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Beauty, thoſe that were handſomeſt yielding the beſt Rate; and ordinary Faces were ſold for leſſer Sums: yet the homelieſt alſo went off; for the Money which was beſtow'd for the faireſt, was given as Portions for the hard-favor'd; ſo that they in ſtead of being bought, they purchas'd Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands for themſelves.</p>
               <p>Far more ſhamefully did the <hi>Phoenician</hi> Maidens order their affairs, when they went into the Temple of <hi>Venus</hi> to proffer their Virginities to ſale, and with that Money ſo gotten, bought them Husbands.</p>
               <p>The ſame Cuſtom was obſerved by the <hi>Cyprian</hi> Maids, who for Money pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted themſelves ſo long to Strangers, till they had gotten Wealth enough to purchaſe Marriage with ſome of their election.</p>
               <p>Nay, the <hi>Armenians</hi> had a Law, according to which the Maids in the antient Temple dedicated to the Goddeſs <hi>Anetis,</hi> whoſe Image was made of Maſſie Gold, ſhould at a ſet time proſtitute themſelves in common to all Men; after which there were none but deſir'd her in Marriage, that had been ſo conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the ſame Goddeſs.</p>
               <p>The antient <hi>Indians</hi> brought their Daughters into the Company of fine Youths, that they might chuſe one out of the number, which in Strength,
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:34669:246"/>ſwiftneſs in Running, Wreſtling, and well-timberdneſs of Body exceeded the other.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Cathaians</hi> obſerve the ſame manner, but upon inviolable promiſes, that ſhe will be burnt with her Husbands Body, if he chance to die before her.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Indian</hi> Women alſo leap into the ſame Funeral Fire; and thoſe that out of fear do not go in to be burnt with their Husbands, are accounted diſhoneſt.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Laxamatees,</hi> near the Lake <hi>Meoſis,</hi> may not Marry before they have ſlain an Enemy: and alſo the <hi>Carmani</hi> may not betroth themſelves before they have brought an Enemy's Head to the King.</p>

                     <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> Brides muſt bring Portions, but in <hi>Japan</hi> the Bridegrooms.</note>The antient <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Greeks</hi> maintain'd quite another Cuſtom than the <hi>Japanners;</hi> for with them the Brides were to bring Portions to the Bridegrooms: wherefore the <hi>Roman</hi> Conſul gave the Daughters of the famous Generals, <hi>Cneius Scipio,</hi> and <hi>Martus Curius,</hi> their Portions out of the Treaſury, becauſe being poor they could not be Marry'd according to their Birth.</p>
               <p>The like did the <hi>Athenians</hi> to the Daughters of the valiant Heroe <hi>Ariſtides.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>Solon</hi> and <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> both <hi>Greek</hi> Law-givers, commanded ſtrictly, That no Bride ſhould bring Money into the Bridegrooms Pocket.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Germans</hi> took no Marriage to be lawful, unleſs the Man produced his promis'd Eſtate: Which Law was alſo obſerv'd by the <hi>Biskiners.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Egyptians</hi> never Marry'd for Eſtates; for if the Woman brought any Riches to the Man, then he, according to their Laws, was to be her Slave.</p>
               <p>Moreover, the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> durſt not ſeem to Marry for Money: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe were ſeverely puniſh'd, that at <hi>Lacedemon</hi> Courted <hi>Lyſander</hi>'s Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and after the Deceaſe of their Father forbore their Suit; which the Judge interpreted thus: <hi>That they had not Courted the Perſons, but their Money.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Juſt ſo it is in <hi>Japan,</hi> where the Man Marries not onely a Bride without a Portion, but muſt give her divers Goods for Marrying of him: Which Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom is likewiſe Extracted from <hi>China;</hi> where the Bride brings no Money to her Bridegroom, though ſhe carry all manner of Houſholdſtuff to his Houſe, as Stools, Chairs, <hi>Umbrello's,</hi> and other things, ſufficient to fill up a ſmall Street; for it is all bought with the Money which the Bridegroom hath given her.</p>

               <p>The like Story <hi>Homer</hi> relates of three Sea-men belonging to <hi>Ulyſſes</hi>'s Fleet, which going aſhore where the <hi>Lotus</hi> grew, would not return, they being ſo much delighted with the taſt of that Fruit.</p>

                  <hi>Wagenaer</hi> and his Retinue found themſelves ſtraitned on all ſides: Before them the Street was fill'd with Goods and Men, that lay heap'd one upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: On one ſide the Flame had paſs'd them; on the other, it went ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what farther from them; behind the Fire purſu'd them very cloſely, whilſt they ſtood in a thick Smoke, full of innumerable Sparks, which were driven by the North Wind like Flakes of Snow: The Fronts of Houſes ſometimes tumbling forwards into the Street, ſo covering in a glowing Grave both Men and Goods, which by reaſon of the Throng could not get away. Sometimes falling ſidelong or inwards, they ſeem'd to cover the Flame, ſo as at preſent to keep it from ſeeking any farther Food: Here crack'd the Wainſcots and Partitions, which ſuddenly taking Fire, haſtned the ruine of the Floors and Walls.

                  <note place="margin">Its Original.</note>Concerning the Original of this Amber are ſeveral Opinions, for ſome think, that it is either the Spawn or Dung of a Whale; others look upon it to be a Spungy Earth that grows in the Sea under the Rocks, by the beating Waves waſh'd off in Pieces, which by reaſon of their lightneſs, Swim above the Water. But thoſe that ſeem to come neareſt the truth, as the Learned <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard Paludanus</hi> judgeth, approving of <hi>Linſchot</hi>'s Opinion, hold Amber to be a ſort of Pitch, ariſing up from the Ground, and hardned by the Sun, and is found not unlike Brimſtone or Coral: But its Original from a Whale hath not the leaſt appearance of truth; for if Amber ſhould proceed from the Spawn or Dung of a Whale, it would needs be found moſt in thoſe places where the greateſt number of Whales frequent: But it is known to the contrary, that <hi>Green-Land, Spitsbergen,</hi> or elſewhere, where theſe Sea-Monſters abound, never produce any Amber; whereas on the contrary, <hi>Soffala, Moſambique, Melinde,</hi> the <hi>Maldivian</hi> Iſlands, the Promontory of <hi>Comoryn,</hi> the Province of <hi>Satſuma</hi> in <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan,</hi> and other <hi>Indian</hi> Countreys, produce Amber, before whoſe Coaſts ſeldom or never any Whales are ſeen to Swim.</p>

               <p>This Trial was perform'd not without great Charms and Incantations; yet all of them paſſing ſafe through the Fire without receiving the leaſt hurt, were again ſet at liberty. Mean while there was great ſuſpicion, that the youngeſt Daughter to the former King (for the preſent King had in a Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion bereav'd his Predeceſſor both of his Life and Crown) might have committed the Fact; becauſe being this King's Concubine, ſhe had ſometime ſhew'd her ſelf very much diſſatisfi'd, becauſe he ſhew'd ſuch exceeding kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and great reſpects to his eldeſt Daughter, and regarded not hers, who alſo acknowledg'd him for her Father: and indeed the ſuſpicion grew the greater when the King was inform'd, that this his Concubine was obſerv'd to laugh, whilſt every one preſent at the Funeral bewail'd the death of the Deceaſed: For this jealouſie the Princeſs, with a great Train of her Ladies of Honor, was forc'd alſo to go through the Fire, all of them paſſing through without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hurt, except the Princeſs, who was very much burnt on both her Feet: therefore ſhe was immediately loaden with Silver Fetters, and committed to a Priſon where none were ſuffer'd to ſpeak with her.

               <p>But whereas <hi>Feſen</hi> produces the beſt Porcelan in <hi>Japan;</hi> ſo in <hi>China,</hi> the Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage <hi>Sinkteſimo.</hi> It is worthy our obſervation, That the Earth, which is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like fine Sand, of which they bake their Porcelan, is digg'd up near the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolis <hi>Hoeicheu,</hi> lying in the Territory of <hi>Nankin,</hi> where they onely knead it into Balls or Pellets,<note place="margin">How it is made.</note> which ſeal'd with the Emperors Arms, are ſold at a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain price, and ſent to <hi>Sinkteſimo;</hi> for this Village onely, by a hidden Power

They prepare the Earth two ſeveral ways: Sometimes they work it ſo ſoon as it comes from <hi>Hoeichen,</hi> after the ſame manner as our <hi>European</hi> Potters prepare their Clay for their Pots and Pans. At other times they let it lye ſo long, till it is grown as hard as a Stone, which they afterwards ſtamp to Powder, ſift it through a very fine Sieve, then mixing it with Water, knead it into Balls, and at laſt preſs it into a Wooden Frame, according to what faſhion they pleaſe: Then they are firſt dry'd in the Wind, and put into an Oven, which fifteen days together is continually hot, and afterwards kept cloſe as many days more, that ſo they may cool by degrees, or elſe they would: break all to pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.

               <p>The warm Fountains that ſpring out of the tops of the Mountains,<note place="margin">Warm Fountains.</note> are no deſpicable Teſtimonies; for the Water being driven upwards by the Heat, forcing its way, ſpouts out; not unlike a Still, in which the purer Spirits or Moiſture goes upwards, and through a Pipe come dropping from it; or like the Fumes which riſe from the Stomach up into the Brain, where gathering Subſtance, Nature diſcharges them through the Mouth or Noſe.</p>

                  </note>After he left <hi>Cokero,</hi> he came on the fourteenth day to <hi>Oriſmo,</hi> where he took great delight in a Stove or Bath, which was cover'd with a very handſom Roof: The Water came running through Copper Cocks into the Bath, from a Brook ſo hot on one ſide, that none can put in their Fingers without ſcald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: But that which is no leſs ſtrange, and a remarkable Privacy in Nature, is, that the ſame Brook on the other ſide flows extreme cold, in one Channel with the hot Water.</p>
               <p>When they prepare a Bath, the Maſter thereof firſt lets the hot Water run in, which he afterwards tempers with the cold, as thoſe that bathe require.</p>
               <p>This Myſtery of Nature is grounded on the Earthy Fire, by which the Waters being heated in deep Pits, ſpring upwards like a Fountain: But ſome Rivers have ſeveral Avenues and narrow Paſſages under the Earth, and ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten loſe their heat before they come to the top; when as others detain their warmth, becauſe they flow through wide Channels, nearer the Subterranean Fire, from whence they riſe up directly: It therefore happens (though very ſeldom) that two Fountains, of which one produces warm, the other cold Water, occaſion'd by the foremention'd Reaſon, flow in one Channel, becauſe each by its ſwift Courſe detains its own Property: And ſo it is with the Brook that in <hi>Oriſmo</hi> affords Water for the Bath.</p>

               <p>The ancient <hi>Germans</hi> made uſe of a River, in which they ſwam every day; though ſometimes they went before Meals into a Bath, which was formerly obſerv'd by the <hi>Romans,</hi> as at this day by the <hi>Turks.</hi>

                  </note>It will not be amiſs to make ſome inquiry, why any one that before he bathes himſelf makes warm but having bathed, it comes cold from him; which happens becauſe the Body before bathing is cold, but warm'd by bathing, makes the Urine cold.</p>
               <p>It is alſo a ſtrange Myſtery, that thoſe that when they go to bathe are no ways thirſty, by bathing become exceeding dry; and on the contrary, thoſe that are deſirous to drink when they go in, ſhall have no mind at all to it when they come out: The Reaſons whereof may proceed hence, <hi>viz.</hi> Thirſt is occaſion'd by Drought; wherefore thoſe that begin to bathe when adry, the Body draws through the Pores, by the inward force of the Vital Spirits, the thinneſt Moiſture, by which the Drought is quenched: But thoſe that do not go thirſty into the Bath, force out their Drink by ſweating, ſo that the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy within becomes dry, and occaſions Thirſt.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> at firſt had dark and pittiful Baths; but when by their Power they had made great Conqueſts, they became Teachers of all Magnificence; which amongſt other things they expreſs'd in their Baths, the erecting and ordering of which,<note place="margin">Riches of the Baths.</note> amaz'd the Eyes of the Beholders.

               <p>The <hi>Sperwer</hi> Frigat Sailing from <hi>Batavia</hi> the tenth of <hi>June</hi> 1653. Landed <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius Keyſar</hi> on <hi>Taoyan,</hi> to ſucceed <hi>Nicholas Verburg</hi> in his Place of Government: from thence the Frigat ſteer'd her Courſe for <hi>Japan;</hi> but overtaken by a great Storm, hapned in the night-time, to be driven near a ſmall Iſland: the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain thereof looking out at the Window ſpy'd the danger; wherefore he us'd all poſſible endeavors to come to an Anchor behind the Iſland, ſo to be out of the way of the hollow Seas; the deſign fell out according to his deſire, but the Ship lying betwixt the Iſland and a great Riff (which breaking the Sea made it very rough) were forc'd to Ride very ſhort at Anchor: the Day diſcover'd the <hi>Chineſe</hi> Coaſt, which was ſo near them, that they could ſee People in Arms
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:34669:282"/>ſtand on the Shore, ſeeming to ſtay there longing to ſee a miſerable Shipwrack: two days the Storm continu'd, then growing calmer they weighed Anchor to get out of ſight of the <hi>Chineſes,</hi> which like hungry Wolves watch'd for a Prey, ſhewing themſelves in great numbers: afterwards the Ship was driven by the Current between <hi>China</hi> and <hi>Formoſa;</hi> but ſoon after the Storm blowing afreſh, they were not able to carry out the leaſt Sail till the Guſts were more favora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: mean while the Ship being ſo miſerably toſs'd ſprung a Leak, ſo that they could ſcarce keep her free with Pumping; ſometimes a Sea beat over her in ſuch a manner, that the Water could ſcarce find ways to run out again, ſeeming as if it would ſink immediately. With theſe inconveniences came far greater; for towards the Evening a Sea waſh'd away one of the Galleries, and ſoon after another the Head, ſo looſning the Boltſprit; yet they had not been in ſuch great danger, had not the Ship rowl'd ſo extremely, and the Seas follow'd one another ſo ſuddenly: they judg'd it convenient to hale up their Mizin, and Sail before the Wind; the ſecond Watch they diſcover'd Land, but the Ship in the dark was got within Muſquet-ſhot of the Shore before they could ſee it: the ſteep Shore ſuffer'd the Ship to run againſt a Rock, which with three blows broke it into a thouſand pieces, and of ſixty four Men eſcap'd onely thirty ſix, moſt of which were miſerably wounded by the ſharp Rocks; thoſe that lay in their Cabbins, being tir'd with watching, died all: amongſt thoſe that were ſav'd was the Captain, <hi>Reinier Egbertſon</hi> of <hi>Amſterdam.</hi> From the Wreck they ſav'd one Barrel of Flower, one Barrel of Salt-Beef, ſome Pork, and a Rundlet of Tent, which prov'd very happily for the wounded. Moreover, they gather'd up as many Pieces of the Ship as would make them a Booth to defend them from the Weather; for they knew not in what Countrey they were, how call'd, or whether inhabited or not, becauſe the Skie being Clouded for ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral days, they could take no obſervation.</p>
               <p>On the ſecond day after they ſuffer'd Shipwrack they ſaw a Man, whom they beckning to come to them ran away; ſoon after came three other, of which one carry'd a Muſquet, the other two Bows and Arrows, which alſo fled from them; but one of the Sea-men running after them unarm'd, got ſome Fire, which they wanted extremely. Againſt the Evening their Tent, or Booth, was ſurrounded with above a hundred Men, wearing Hats made of Horſe-hair. The next day came a ſmall Army, being about two thouſand Foot and Horſe, while the <hi>Hollanders</hi> were making of a bigger Tent. The Commander of them fetch'd the Book-keeper <hi>Henry Haemel,</hi> with the Pilot, Quartermaſter,<note place="margin">Strange uſage by the <hi>Core<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> of thirty ſix Shi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> and a Boy, out of the Booth, which were all four thrown down on the Earth before the General, at which the whole Army made a kind of ſtrange noiſe. The <hi>Hollanders</hi> that remain'd in the Tent, believ'd certainly, that their Companions were put to a miſerable death; but they us'd them not ſo cruelly: for the <hi>Coreans</hi> onely put an Iron Chain about their Necks, to which a great Bell was made faſt under their Chin. Then ſome of the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers went into the Booth, and had a great deal of Diſcourſe which the <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> underſtood not; but they ſignifi'd to them that they intended to go to <hi>Japan,</hi> but ſuffering Shipwrack they were come aſhore there to ſave themſelves. The <hi>Chineſes</hi> look'd upon thoſe Goods which they had ſav'd, and finding onely a little Meal, Salt-Beef and Pork, they brought ſome Rice boyl'd in Water, which was a great refreſhment. Not long continu'd their joy that they were not in a barren Countrey; for whilſt they were eating, a great many of the Soldiers came running towards their Tent, every one holding a Rope in his
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:34669:282"/>hand, which made the <hi>Hollanders</hi> think that they ſhould be bound and kill'd: but this fear ſoon vaniſh'd, when the <hi>Coreans</hi> ran with all ſpeed towards the Wreck, every one laboring to hale the Wood aſhore, which burning they carry'd the Iron away. In the interim the Pilot taking an obſervation, found that it was <hi>Quelpaerds-Iſland</hi> where they had loſt their Ship, and were in thirty three Degrees and thirty two Minutes Latitude. Moreover, the <hi>Coreans</hi> ſtill buſied themſelves in haling aſhore the Pieces of the Wreck, and burning it for the Iron; and laſtly they ſet the whole Wreck on Fire, which might have coſt them dear: for two Braſs-Guns deeply loaden went off, but it ſo hapned, that the Muzzles of them lay towards the Sea: this Blow ſtruck ſuch a fear amongſt them, that every one fled, and coming to the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> deſir'd to know of them if it would do the like again; but they informing that there were no more Guns that were Charged in the Ship, they went on with their work.</p>
               <p>Moreover, the <hi>Hollanders</hi> viſited the Governor of <hi>Quelpaerds-Iſle,</hi> and preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him with a Bottle of Tent, which pleas'd him ſo well, that he became very kind to them, ſending them boyl'd Rice twice a day, and bid them come and ſee the puniſhment which would be inflicted on thoſe that had robb'd the wreck'd Veſſel. The Iron they had ſtole was tied to their Backs, and they themſelves laid upon the Ground, receiv'd ſeveral Drubbings on the Balls of their Feet with a Stick about a Fathom long, and as thick as an ordinary Boy's Arm, ſo beating them unmercifully.</p>

                  </note>After this was over, the <hi>Hollanders</hi> had order to be gone with all their things; ſo travelling with a Guard of Foot and Horſe, they went that day four Leagues, and Lodg'd in a ſmall Town call'd <hi>Tadjunch,</hi> in an old Store-houſe: from thence they went to the City <hi>Moggan,</hi> where the Governor of <hi>Quelpaerds</hi> keeps his Court; here on a great Market place three thouſand Armed Men were drawn up in Battel aray: The Governor caus'd <hi>Henry Hamell,</hi> with the Pilot and Quartermaſter to come to him, and ask'd them where they were going? at which <hi>Hamel</hi> cry'd ſeveral times, <hi>Japan</hi> and <hi>Nangeſaque;</hi> at which the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor nodding his Head ſeem'd to underſtand it.

Every day they had their allowance of boyl'd Rice, wheaten Flower, and another ſtrange Food which they could not eat, wherefore they liv'd moſt upon Rice. The Governor, a Man aged about ſeventy years, and of a noble Aſpect, ſignifi'd to them, that he would Write to the King, to know what ſhould be done with them, but it would be a conſiderable time before he could have an Anſwer; for the Place where the King kept his Court was thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Leagues over-Sea, and above twenty Leagues from <hi>Moggan:</hi> But whilſt they waited for it, the <hi>Hollanders</hi> had freſh Meat allow'd them, and alſo leave for ſix at a time to walk abroad by turns.

                  <hi>Hamel</hi> alſo ask'd him what he was? and although he had almoſt forgot his Native Tongue, yet he told him <q>That he was born in a Village call'd <hi>De Riip</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> and nam'd <hi>John Johnſon Welterre,</hi> and that <hi>Anno</hi> 1626. he Sail'd in a Ship from <hi>Amſterdam</hi> to the <hi>Eaſt-Indies;</hi> afterwards by order of the <hi>Indian</hi> Councel in <hi>Batavia</hi> Sail'd in the <hi>Ouwerkerk</hi> Ketch to <hi>Japan,</hi> but by contrary Winds forc'd upon the Coaſt of <hi>Corea,</hi> freſh Water began to grow very ſcant; wherefore (ſaid he) I was commanded, with my Countreyman <hi>Derick Gerritſon,</hi> and an <hi>Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dammer</hi> call'd <hi>John Peterſon Verbaeſt,</hi> to go aſhore, to ſee if we could find any freſh Water: no ſooner had we ſet foot aſhore, but we were all three ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded and carry'd up into the Countrey to the King's Court, where ever ſince we have had Meat, Drink, and Clothing, but could never obtain leave to go with ſome Veſſel or other to <hi>Japan:</hi> and though he had for ſeveral years entreated leave of the Court to depart, yet they had always one An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, which was, <hi>That the King did not give leave to any Strangers to go out of his Kingdom:</hi> which Sentence all <hi>Hollanders,</hi> or what elſe ſoever they be, are ſure to undergo.

               <p>Mean while the time came, in which the old Governor was to give place to the new; for every three years they obſerve change of Government amongſt the <hi>Coreans.</hi> The old Lord had a very great inclination for the <hi>Hollanders;</hi> for before he went away he provided them againſt the next Winter, giving every one a Coat, a pair of Buskins and Stockings.

<pb n="471" facs="tcp:34669:290"/>becauſe the Inhabitants there that day kept a Feſtival, for the departed Souls. The whole City was in a Hurry, every one was in his beſt Apparel, carrying his Idol out of the City, to the Graves of their neareſt Relations; where the Idol being ſet down, both young and old fell on their Faces to Worſhip it, and Pray'd very earneſtly, that <hi>Amida, Xaca, Canon,</hi> or any other god (for every one ſerves whom he liſt) would be pleas'd to ſhew Mercy to the Souls of their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceas'd Friends, that they might not be tortur'd with thoſe that dy'd wickedly, in the boyling Waters of <hi>Singok,</hi> but that they might be carry'd, and remain in the place of Everlaſting Happineſs. Moreover, they believe, that the Souls of the Deceas'd, for ſome years, wander up and down about their Graves.</p>
               <p>This Office of Sacrificing and Praying for the Dead, is generally perform'd by the young Men out of the City; and when they have done, every one takes up his Idol, and go one after another into the City, after the manner of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion: But in their return, they talk to themſelves, as if they had a Soul that walk'd with them, with which they hold a very ſerious Diſcourſe. And thus they continue till they come to their Houſes, where they prepare all manner of Dainties for the Soul; ſome place the Diſhes with Meat under their Pent-Houſes, others upon the Roof, where they let it ſtand about half an hour, then fetching it in, and ſetting it up very ſafe, the young Men run Hooting and Hollowing out of the City, ſtriking in the Air with Boughs of Trees, ſo (as they ſay) to drive the Souls of the Deceas'd back again to their Graves: Then taking Breath, they return home, where they ſpend the whole Night in all manner of Laſciviouſneſs: But this Ceremony which they uſe to the Souls, are obſerv'd ſeveral ways in <hi>Japan,</hi> for in other places (as we have at large de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd before) they throw Stones againſt, and on the top of the Houſes, ſo to drive the Souls back to their Graves.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, The King of the Province <hi>Mewarry</hi> keeps a brave Court in this City: Next to which is a <hi>Seraglio,</hi> wherein, a conſiderable number of Ladies are kept for his Concubines. Againſt the Evening, the four <hi>Hollanders</hi> and the Interpreter being Aboard again, they made Sail, and Steer'd between ſeveral Iſles to <hi>Binga,</hi> a fair City, which appears with ſeveral Turrets and high Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples: Againſt the Evening, they Stem'd with the Iſland <hi>Sinoja,</hi> and in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing had ſight of <hi>Fibi,</hi> when a ſtiff Gale out of the North drove them more to the South-ward; ſo that ſoon after they came near <hi>Margan</hi> Rocks, which riſe very high out of the Sea; on the higheſt of them lies a curious neat Town; below which the Rock is very artificially hewn out, for a convenient Haven againſt all Winds whatſoever: Here the Ambaſſador drop'd Anchor, and when grown ſomewhat calmer, ſtood out again, but could not reach beyond <hi>Fibi,</hi> how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, at Night he got to <hi>Daſacci;</hi> and although the Storm began to blow afreſh, yet next day he got to <hi>Ouſimata,</hi> from whence he Sail'd over to <hi>Wota,</hi> where he lay at an Anchor all Night, and in the Morning Weighing, got to the Banks before <hi>Muro,</hi> where he ran a ground, the Barque giving a great blow, and had without doubt burſt aſunder, had not the Wind blown off from the Shore, ſo that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling out all their Sails, they at laſt got off, and afterwards judg'd it convenient to fall down to the Iſland <hi>Jeſima,</hi> ſo to get into a deeper Water.

<pb n="472" facs="tcp:34669:291"/>gave notice thereof to the Main-Land, by fireing them in the Night, or making a great Smoke in the day time; whereupon they immediately Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Sea-Shore, and ſent off ſeveral Veſſels well Man'd; ſince which time they obſerv'd the ſame Cuſtom with their Beacons, either in bad Weather, or when any one endeavors to make his eſcape, that hath by ſome means or other incur'd the Emperors diſpleaſure.

The Fiſh thus wounded, immediately bounces towards the Ground; whereupon they give him ſtill more and more Line. If the Line ſhould chance to be foul of any thing, it would certainly over-ſet the Boat. At the end of the Rope hangs a Barrel, which driving on the top they follow; but it oftentimes happens, that the Whale ſinking too deep, hides both Line and Barrel. At other times he lies rolling on the Ground, or comes driving dead up again: If he chanceth to be yet living, they pierce his Sides with Lances, which the Whale feeling, makes ſo great a buſtle, that the Seamen run no ſmall hazard of loſing their Lives.

                  <note place="margin">Strange way of Marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note>¶ THe <hi>Negopatam</hi> Parents Marry their Children in the eighth and ninth year of their age; at which Solemnities the Bride and Bridegroom ſit in a Sedan one over againſt another, whilſt the Gueſts drink themſelves dead drunk, and Dance, Hollow, and clap their Hands like frantick Perſons.</p>
               <p>¶ THe <hi>Hollanders</hi> Store-houſe is built with croſs Timber-work, mix'd with Stone. When the Governor of the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company comes abroad, either on Horſeback, or carry'd in a <hi>Palankin,</hi> or Sedan, he hath a great Guard of <hi>Moors</hi> with him, all Arm'd with round Shields, and long Swords.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Hollanders</hi> barter here a ſort of <hi>Japan</hi> Wood, us'd at the burning of dead Corpſes; and alſo the <hi>China</hi> Root, <hi>Japan</hi> Cheſts, Porcelan, and Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phire, againſt all ſorts of Cottons. Formerly they us'd to freight their Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels with <hi>Negopatam</hi> Rice; but ſince <hi>Japan</hi> abounds in that Grain, they gave over that Trade.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company drive a great Trade in Elephants, of which <hi>Ceylon</hi> affords the beſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">How they tranſport Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants.</note>The tranſporting of them is ſomewhat ſtrange, being in large Barques, cover'd over on the top with <hi>Palmito</hi>-Trees, cut off cloſe by the Ground: the Leaves whereof are the moſt acceptable Food for the Elephants. When the Barque carries the Elephant aboard of a great Ship, they blind and hoiſe him over with ſtrong Cables; under his Belly they put pieces of four-doubled Canvaſe, ſo broad, that it reaches from his fore to his hind-Legs; and when thus hoiſed over, they put them under Deck, and place them one over againſt another, putting onely a Manger with Fodder between them.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Hollanders</hi> meddle not with the looking after theſe Monſters, but the <hi>Ceylonians</hi> creep under their Bellies, and rake away the Dung.</p>
               <p>¶ THe Elephant is the chief pattern of the wonderful Works of God.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Job</hi> 40. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 15, 16. <hi>Behemoth.</hi>
                  </note> God calls him <hi>Behemoth: Behold now</hi> Behemoth <hi>which I made with thee, he eateth graſs as an Ox, Lo now his ſtrength is in his loins, and his force is on the navel of his belly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> and <hi>Nicholas Lyra,</hi> following the Opinion of moſt of the
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:34669:304"/>
                  <hi>Rabbins,</hi> underſtand that <hi>Behemoth</hi> is an Elephant, and created on the ſame day that Man was; and though it be a fearful Monſter, yet it is afraid of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind: for he ſatisfies himſelf like an Ox with what the Earth produceth, and trembles at the ſmell of a Mans foot-ſteps.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Indian</hi> Elephants far exceed thoſe of <hi>Africa.</hi> The ſtrength of thoſe in <hi>India</hi> may be judg'd by the great Towers which they carry on their backs.</p>
               <p>In the Wars by <hi>Antiochus Eupator</hi> againſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> every Elephant carry'd a ſmall Tower with thirty ſix Soldiers, beſides the <hi>Indian</hi> which guided him. That theſe Monſters live three hundred years <hi>Ariſtotle, Pliny, Ambroſe,</hi> and <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> witneſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Policy of the Elephants.</note>Moreover, <hi>Philoſtratus</hi> the <hi>Greek</hi> Writer ſaith, That the Elephant is likeſt to Man of any Beaſt in Policy and Prudence: his Sence the Elephant expreſſes two ways, either by his natural Apprehenſion, or by good Inſtruction: to the firſt muſt be reckon'd, that the Elephant rowls himſelf in the Mudd againſt the heat of the Sun; and when he goes to drink, he firſt ſtirs the Water with his Snout, that he may not ſwallow any hurtful Creature; which is more cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible than what <hi>Theophilactus Simocatus</hi> ſaith, That the Beaſt ſtirs the Water be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is afraid of his own Shadow. When they go to wade through any River, the youngeſt walk before, for otherwiſe the old ones would ſink and make the Ground deeper by their weight, ſo that the young ones could not poſſibly get over.</p>
               <p>But concerning the Apprehenſions of this Beaſt, ſeveral credible Witneſſes give us many remarkable Examples. <hi>Seneca, Pliny,</hi> and <hi>Suetonius</hi> relate, That the Elephants in the Theatre at <hi>Rome,</hi> not onely Fenc'd with Swords, but Danc'd on the Ropes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hieronimus Oſorius</hi> relates, That <hi>Anno</hi> 1514. an <hi>Indian</hi> Elephant bow'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf three times to Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Augerus Busbequius</hi> relates in his Embaſſy to the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Emperor, That he ſaw a young Elephant, who obſerv'd the ſteps, and Danc'd exactly after the Time of a ſtring'd Inſtrument, and caſt a Ball backwards.</p>
               <p>It deſerves peculiar obſervation,<note place="margin">Epiſt. Lypſ. ad Janum. Hautanum.</note> what <hi>Peter Bellon,</hi> an eye-witneſs, related to <hi>Carolus Cluſius,</hi> who told it again to <hi>Juſtus Lipſius,</hi> That his Elephant coming weary and hungry into the Stable, where he found an Aſs eating of Corn, he drove him from the Manger, and eat up what he found: but ſoon after the Maſter of the Elephant coming into the Stable, gave him his fill of Corn; the Beaſt conſidering the wrong which hunger had made him do the Aſs, he divided the Corn, and gave the Aſs as much as he had taken from him.</p>
               <p>This vaſt Monſter,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 9.</note> as we ſaid, is very fearful of Man-kind. <hi>Pliny</hi> ſaith, <q>So ſoon as the Elephant ſpies the foot-ſteps of a Man, though he never ſaw one before, he is afraid of private Ambuſcades, and looking about him, goes not a ſtep forwarder, but makes it known to his followers, ſo from one to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry laſt; whereupon they all return.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The ſame <hi>Pliny</hi> relates,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 5.</note> That <hi>Bacchus</hi> ſet thirty Elephants againſt ſeveral Priſoners which he had condemn'd; but they, leſs beſtial than their Maſter, would not obſerve or obey his cruel Commands: Wherefore <hi>Ptolomy Phyſcon</hi> made the Elephants drunk when he would have the naked <hi>Jews,</hi> with their Wives to be put to death. And full as fearful they are of Stags.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great had paſt beyond the utmoſt bounds of the <hi>Hercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lean Pillars</hi> and <hi>Bacchus</hi> Encamp'd his Army, thoſe that were ſent into the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts for Wood, came amazedly running back upon the ſight of a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:34669:304"/>of Elephants coming towards their Army: at which <hi>Porus,</hi> an <hi>Indian</hi> King encourag'd <hi>Alexander,</hi> telling him, That he need not fear the leaſt danger, if his Troopers took but ſome Hogs on their Horſes, and with beating com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell them to make a noiſe, at which the Elephants all return'd back again into the Woods.</p>
               <p>¶ BUt to return again to <hi>Malacca:</hi> This City is inhabited by <hi>Hollanders, Chineſes,</hi> and <hi>Malacquers.</hi> Half a Mile off at Sea lies the <hi>Red Iſland,</hi> from whence the <hi>Hollanders</hi> took <hi>Malacca</hi> from the <hi>Portugueſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Malacquers</hi> of <hi>Queda</hi> ſome years ſince maintain'd a War againſt the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company, but were ſubdu'd by force of Arms.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queda</hi> belongs to the Queen of <hi>Achien</hi> on <hi>Sumatra;</hi> who not long ſince would have Marry'd with a <hi>Hollander,</hi> but that the Councel in <hi>Batavia,</hi> for ſeveral weighty Reaſons, judg'd it no way convenient.</p>

                     <hi>Dingding</hi> an Iſland.</note>¶ BEtween <hi>Queda</hi> and <hi>Peru,</hi> thirty Leagues from <hi>Meaco,</hi> lies the uninhabited Iſle <hi>Dingding,</hi> cloſe by the <hi>Marine</hi> Coaſt.</p>
               <p>Here is that famous red Wood, of which the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company, <hi>Anno</hi> 1663. made a trial.</p>
               <p>The Haven before <hi>Dingding</hi> full of Fiſh, and very ſafe, which they enter Eaſtward, and go out Weſtward.</p>
               <p>The Water which flows from the Mountains along the Valleys into the Sea, is as good as any freſh Water in <hi>India.</hi>

               <p>A League Weſtward from <hi>Dingding</hi> appear the three Iſlands, which the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> for a certain accident call'd <hi>The Man-eaters Iſles,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Weeſop</hi> and <hi>Schelling</hi> Frigats were caſt away there, and the People which were ſav'd, going aſhore were all ſlain by the Inhabitants.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno</hi> 1661. five Ships going from <hi>Malacca</hi> to fetch their Countrey-men, found them unbury'd; whereupon they brought their Guns aſhore, to take revenge on the Cannibals, and built a Ship of the Pieces of the Wreck that were remaining, which was afterwards us'd at <hi>Malacca.</hi>

               <p>This <hi>Meſopatam</hi> is a great City, inhabited by <hi>Moors</hi> that drive a vaſt Trade with large Ships; the Tackle whereof is made of Trees, as we mention'd before.</p>
               <p>¶ IN <hi>Peleacato</hi> is alſo no ſmall Trade driven, the <hi>Hollanders</hi> having a Fort there cloſe under the City, fortifi'd with ſixty Guns, which was aſſault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Natives; but being beaten off by <hi>Laurence Pitman,</hi> left a conſiderable number of their Party dead behind them: after which <hi>Peleacato</hi> came wholly under the ſubjection of the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company.</p>
               <p>The Veſſels which they have there are very remarkable, and by them call'd <hi>Catamarous,</hi> being four round pieces of Wood ty'd together: he that ſteers it ſits with his back-ſide in the Water, Dabbles with his Feet, and Rows with an Oar, ſmall in the middle, and broad at the end, which he moves to and again, ſo making his way very faſt through the Water.</p>
